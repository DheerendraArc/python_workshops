      "Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University,[8] is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco. Its 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2)[9] campus is one of the largest in the United States.[note 1] Stanford also has land and facilities elsewhere.[7][9]\n",
      "The university was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year. Stanford was a former Governor of California and U.S. Senator; he made his fortune as a railroad tycoon. The school admitted its first students 125 years ago on October 1, 1891,[2][3] as a coeducational and non-denominational institution.\n",
      "Stanford University struggled financially after Leland Stanford's death in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[12] Following World War II, Provost Frederick Terman supported faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would later be known as Silicon Valley.[13] The rise of Silicon Valley helped Stanford become one of the world's most prestigious universities.[note 2] The university is also one of the top fundraising institutions in the country, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.[23]\n",
      "There are three academic schools that have both undergraduate and graduate students and another four professional schools. Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference. It has gained 111 NCAA team championships,[24] the second-most for a university, 483 individual championships, the most in Division I,[25] and has won the NACDA Directors' Cup, recognizing the university with the best overall athletic team achievement, for 22 consecutive years, beginning in 1994–1995.[26]\n",
      "Stanford faculty and alumni have founded a large number of companies that produce more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue, equivalent to the 10th-largest economy in the world.[27] It is the alma mater of 30 living billionaires, 17 astronauts, and 20 Turing Award laureates.[note 3] It is also one of the leading producers of members of the United States Congress.[48][49] Sixty Nobel laureates and seven Fields Medalists have been affiliated with Stanford as students, alumni, faculty or staff.[50]\n",

      "Stanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford, dedicated to Leland Stanford Jr, their only child. The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Despite being impacted by earthquakes in both 1906 and 1989, the campus was rebuilt each time. In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by Herbert Hoover to preserve artifacts related to World War I. The Stanford Medical Center, completed in 1959, is a teaching hospital with over 800 beds. The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (originally named the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), which was established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.[51]\n",
      "Most of Stanford University is on an 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2)[9] campus on the San Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of the Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley) approximately 37 miles (60 km) southeast of San Francisco and approximately 20 miles (30 km) northwest of San Jose; this is the founding grant. In 2008, 60% of this land remained undeveloped.[52] Besides the central campus described below, the university also operates at several more remote locations, some elsewhere on the main campus, some further afield (see below).\n",
      "Stanford's main campus includes a census-designated place within unincorporated Santa Clara County, although some of the university land (such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park) is within the city limits of Palo Alto. The campus also includes much land in unincorporated San Mateo County (including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve), as well as in the city limits of Menlo Park (Stanford Hills neighborhood), Woodside, and Portola Valley.[53]\n",
      "The academic central campus is adjacent to Palo Alto, bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Boulevard, and Sand Hill Road. The United States Postal Service has assigned it two ZIP codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail. It lies within area code 650.\n",
      "Stanford currently operates or intends to operate in various locations outside of its central campus.\n",

      "Many Stanford faculty members live in the \"Faculty Ghetto\", within walking or biking distance of campus.[62] The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned entirely by Stanford. Similar to a condominium, the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the \"Ghetto\" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall Silicon Valley values. However, it remains an expensive area in which to own property, and the average price of single-family homes on campus is actually higher than in Palo Alto.[citation needed]\n",
      "Some of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park. Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the Palo Alto Unified School District for several schools including Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School.[63] El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park (established 1914), is also on Stanford land.[64]\n",
      "Contemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts and art gallery, the Stanford Mausoleum and the Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin sculpture garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish. Frank Lloyd Wright's 1937 Hanna–Honeycomb House and the 1919 Lou Henry Hoover House are both listed on the National Historic Register. The Claw (officially White Memorial Fountain) between the Stanford Bookstore and the Old Union is a popular place to meet and to engage in the Stanford custom of “fountain hopping”; it was installed in 1964 and designed by Aristides Demetrios after a national competition as a memorial for two brothers in the class of 1949, William N. White and John B. White II, one of whom died before graduating and one shortly after in 1952.[65][66][67][68]\n",
      "Stanford University is a tax-exempt corporate trust governed by a privately appointed Board of Trustees with a maximum membership of 38.[6][note 4] Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually.[70] A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by ballot.[69] The Stanford trustees also oversee the Stanford Research Park, the Stanford Shopping Center, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital).[71]\n",
      "The Board appoints a President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and prescribe the duties of professors and course of study, manage financial and business affairs, and appoint nine vice presidents.[72] The Provost is the chief academic and budget officer, to whom the deans of each of the seven schools report.[73] John Etchemendy was named the 12th Provost in September 2000.[74]\n",
      "As of 2013 the university was organized into seven academic schools.[75] The schools of Humanities and Sciences (27 departments), Engineering (9 departments), and Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (4 departments) have both graduate and undergraduate programs while the Schools of Law, Medicine, Education and Business have graduate programs only. The powers and authority of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other academic administrators, but most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate, made up of 55 elected representatives of the faculty.[76]\n",
      "The Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford University and all registered students are members. Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as a ticket by the entire student body.[77]\n",
      "Stanford is the beneficiary of a special clause in the California Constitution, which explicitly exempts Stanford property from taxation so long as the property is used for educational purposes.[78]\n",
      "The university's endowment, managed by the Stanford Management Company, was valued at $22.2 billion in August 2015, 3.6% over the previous year.[79][80] The endowment fell 25% in 2009 as a result of the late-2000s recession, but posted gains of 14.4% in 2010 and 22.4% in 2011, when it was valued at $16.5 billion.[81]\n",
      "Stanford has been the top fundraising university in the United States for several years. It raised $911 million in 2006,[82] $832 million in 2007,[83] $785 million in 2008,[84] $640 million in 2009,[85] $599 million in 2010,[86] $709 million in 2011,[87] and $1.035 billion in 2012, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.[23] In 2013 and 2014 it raised $932 million and $928 million.[87] Payouts from the Stanford endowment covered approximately 23% of University expenses in the 2014 fiscal year, compared to Princeton at 55% and Harvard at 35%.[88]\n",
      "In 2006, President John L. Hennessy launched a five-year campaign called the Stanford Challenge, which reached its $4.3 billion fundraising goal in 2009, two years ahead of time, but continued fundraising for the duration of the campaign. It concluded on December 31, 2011, having raised a total of $6.23 billion and breaking the previous campaign fundraising record of $3.88 billion held by Yale.[89][90] Specifically, the campaign raised $253.7 million for undergraduate financial aid, as well as $2.33 billion for its initiative in \"Seeking Solutions\" to global problems, $1.61 billion for \"Educating Leaders\" by improving K-12 education, and $2.11 billion for \"Foundation of Excellence\" aimed at providing academic support for Stanford students and faculty. Funds supported 366 new fellowships for graduate students, 139 new endowed chairs for faculty, and 38 new or renovated buildings. The new funding also enabled the construction of a facility for stem cell research; a new campus for the business school; an expansion of the law school; a new Engineering Quad; a new art and art history building; an on-campus concert hall; a new art museum; and a planned expansion of the medical school, among other things.[91][92]\n",
      "Stanford follows a quarter system with Autumn quarter usually starting in late September and Spring Quarter ending in early June.[93] The full-time, four-year undergraduate program has an arts and sciences focus with high graduate student coexistence.[93] Stanford is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.[94]\n",
      "Full-time undergraduate tuition was $42,690 for 2013–2014.[95] Stanford's admission process is need-blind for US citizens and permanent residents; while it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid, with an average aid package of $31,411.[95] In 2012–13, the university awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an average aid package of $40,460.[95] Eighty percent of students receive some form of financial aid.[95] Stanford has a no-loan policy.[95] For undergraduates admitted in 2015, Stanford waives tuition, room, and board for most families with incomes below $65,000, and most families with incomes below $125,000 are not required to pay tuition; those with incomes up to $150,000 may have tuition significantly reduced.[96] 17% of students receive Pell Grants,[95] a common measure of low-income students at a college.\n",
      "As of 2016 the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversaw eighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes.[97]\n",
      "Other Stanford-affiliated institutions include the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), the Stanford Research Institute (an independent institution which originated at the university), the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace (a major public policy think tank that attracts visiting scholars from around the world), and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (a multidisciplinary design school in cooperation with the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of Potsdam that integrates product design, engineering, and business management education).[citation needed]\n",
      "Stanford is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, a collaboration with the King Center to publish the King papers held by the King Center.[98] It also runs the John S. Knight Fellowship for Professional Journalists and the Center for Ocean Solutions, which brings together marine science and policy to address challenges facing the ocean.[99]\n",
      "As of 2014 Stanford University Libraries (SUL) held a collection of more than 9.3 million volumes, nearly 300,000 rare or special books, 1.5 million e-books, 2.5 million audiovisual materials, 77,000 serials, nearly 6 million microform holdings, and thousands of other digital resources.[100]\n",
      "The main library in the SU library system is Green Library, which also contains various meeting and conference rooms, study spaces, and reading rooms. Lathrop Library (previously Meyer Library, demolished in 2015), holds various student-accessible media resources and houses one of the largest East Asia collections with 540,000 volumes.\n",
      "Stanford University is home to the Cantor Center for Visual Arts museum with 24 galleries, sculpture gardens, terraces, and a courtyard first established in 1891 by Jane and Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. The Center's collection of works by Rodin is among the largest in the world[101] The Thomas Welton Stanford Gallery, built in 1917, serves as a teaching resource for the Department of Art & Art History as well as an exhibition venue. There are outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily sculptures, but some murals as well. The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden near Roble Hall features includes wood carvings and \"totem poles.\"\n",
      "The Stanford music department sponsors many ensembles including five choirs, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, Stanford Taiko, and the Stanford Wind Ensemble. Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram's Head Theatrical Society, the Stanford Improvisors,[102] the Stanford Shakespeare Society, and the Stanford Savoyards, a group dedicated to performing the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. There are award-winning a cappella music groups including the Mendicants,[103] Counterpoint,[104] the Stanford Fleet Street Singers,[105] Harmonics, Mixed Company,[106] Testimony, Talisman, Everyday People, and Raagapella.[107]\n",
      "The creative writing program brings young writers to campus via the Stegner Fellowships and other graduate scholarship programs. Knight Journalism Fellows are invited to spend a year at the campus taking seminars and courses of their choice. The Stanford Spoken Word Collective, an extracurricular writing and performance group, also serves as the school's poetry slam team.[108]\n",
      "Stanford also hosts various publishing courses for professionals. The Stanford Professional Publishing Course, which was offered on campus since the late 1970s, brought together international publishing professionals to discuss changing business models in magazine and book publishing. It ended in 2009, although the tradition has continued at Yale with the Yale Publishing Course that began in 2010. Videos from the Stanford Professional Publishing Courses were available on their website as of 2014.[109]\n",
      "Notably, Stanford occupies the number one position in numerous domestic college ranking measures, leading Slate to dub Stanford in 2014 as \"the Harvard of the 21st century,\"[118] and The New York Times in the same year to conclude that \"Stanford University has become America’s 'it' school, by measures that Harvard once dominated.\"[119] From polls done by The Princeton Review in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, the most commonly named \"dream college\" for students was Stanford; separately, parents, too, most frequently named Stanford as their \"dream college.\"[120] A 2003 Gallup poll had Stanford tied for second as the most prestigious university in the eyes of the general public.[121] The inaugural 2017 Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings picked Stanford as the No. 1 school in the United States.[122][123]\n",
      "Globally, the Times Higher Education (THE) World Reputation Rankings placed it third in the world in 2016,[124] while the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) ranked Stanford second most of the time from 2003 to 2016.[125]\n",
      "Stanford is one of the most successful universities in creating companies and licensing its inventions to existing companies; it is often held up as a model for technology transfer.[135][136]\n",
      "Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing is responsible for commercializing developments and has been run by Katherine Ku since 1991. She took over from Niels Reimers who had been with the office for 23 years.[137][138]\n",
      "Stanford faculty and alumni have founded many companies including Google, Hewlett-Packard, Nike, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn, and Yahoo!, and companies founded by Stanford alumni generate more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue, equivalent to the 10th-largest economy in the world.[27]\n",
      "Developments include:\n",
      "[151]\n",
      "Stanford enrolled 7,061 undergraduate[95] and 11,075 graduate students[95] as of October 2013, and women comprised 47% of undergraduates and 41% of professional and graduate students.[95] In the same academic year, the freshman retention rate was 99%.\n",
      "Stanford awarded 1,715 undergraduate degrees, 2,278 Master's degrees, 764 doctoral degrees, and 366 professional degrees in the 2011–2012 school year.[95] The four-year graduation rate in the class of 2011 was 76%, and the six-year rate was 96%.[95] The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or \"coterm\") program, which allows students to earn a master's degree as an extension of their undergraduate program.[154]\n",
      "As of 2010, fifteen percent of undergraduates were first-generation students.[155]\n",
      "As of 2013, 89% of undergraduate students lived in on-campus university housing. First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus, and all undergraduates are guaranteed housing for all four undergraduate years.[95][156] Undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, row houses, and fraternities and sororities.[157] At Manzanita Park, 118 mobile homes were installed as \"temporary\" housing from 1969 to 1991, but as of 2015 was the site of newer dorms Castano, Kimball, Lantana, and the Humanities House, completed in 2015.[158][159] Most student residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are reserved for freshman, sophomores, or upperclass students and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male fraternities, three are all-female sororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors), including all Wilbur dorms except for Arroyo and Okada.[160]\n",
      "Several residences are considered theme houses. The Academic, Language and Culture Houses include EAST (Education And Society Themed House), Hammarskjöld (International Themed House), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Themed House), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison Française (French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European Themed House), Storey (Human Biology Themed House), and Yost (Spanish Language and Culture). Cross-Cultural Themed Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Themed House), Okada (Asian-American Themed House in Wilbur Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Themed House in Lagunita Court). Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Academic Focus), Branner Hall (Community Service), Kimball (Arts & Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority).[157] Theme houses predating the current \"theme\" classification system are Columbae (Social Change Through Nonviolence, since 1970),[161] and Synergy (Exploring Alternatives, since 1972).[162]\n",
      "Co-ops or \"Self-Ops\" are another housing option. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial LGBT house),[163] and Synergy.[164] Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op.[165]\n",
      "As of 2015 around 55 percent of the graduate student population lived on campus.[166] First-year graduate students are guaranteed on-campus housing. Stanford also subsidizes off-campus apartments in nearby Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Mountain View for graduate students who are guaranteed on-campus housing but are unable to live on campus due to a lack of space.[167]\n",
      "As of 2016 Stanford had 16 male varsity sports and 20 female varsity sports,[168] 19 club sports[169] and about 27 intramural sports[170] In 1930, following a unanimous vote by the Executive Committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department adopted the mascot \"Indian.\" The Indian symbol and name were later dropped by President Richard Lyman in 1972, after objections from Native American students and a vote by the student senate.[171] The sports teams are now officially referred to as the \"Stanford Cardinal\", referring to the deep red color, not the cardinal bird. Stanford is a member of the Pac-12 Conference in most sports, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in several other sports, and the America East Conference in field hockey[172] with the participation in the inter-collegiate NCAA's Division I FBS.\n",
      "Its traditional sports rival is Berkeley, the neighbor to the north in the East Bay. The winner of the annual \"Big Game\" between the Cal and Cardinal football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe.[173]\n",
      "Stanford has had at least one NCAA team champion every year since the 1976–77 school year[174] and has earned 111 NCAA national team titles since its establishment, second most, and only 2 fewer than the four times larger enrollment UCLA Bruins, and Stanford has won 483 individual national championships, the most by any university.[24] Stanford has won the award for the top-ranked collegiate athletic program — the NACDA Directors' Cup, formerly known as the Sears Cup – annually for the past twenty-two straight years.[175][176][177] Stanford athletes have won medals in every Olympic Games since 1912, winning 270 Olympic medals total, 139 of them gold.[178] In the 2008 Summer Olympics, and 2016 Summer Olympics, Stanford won more Olympic medals than any other university in the United States.[179][180] Stanford athletes won 16 medals at the 2012 Summer Games (12 gold, 2 silver and 2 bronze), and 27 medals at the 2016 Summer Games.[181]\n",
      "Students and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The Stanford Office for Religious Life's mission is \"to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community\" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean. Stanford Memorial Church, in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the \"Protestant Ecumenical Christian\" tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life. UPW sometimes has multifaith services.[194] In addition the church is used by the Catholic community and by some of the other Christian denominations at Stanford. Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has for over 20 years allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and now legal weddings.\n",
      "In addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes organizations that serve atheist, Baha'i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islam, Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year.[195]\n",
      "The Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of their course and work schedules; the center displays the \"Windhover\" paintings by Nathan Olivera, the late Stanford professor and artist.[196]\n",
      "Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to the student groups; these include the Catholic Community at Stanford[197] and Hillel at Stanford.[198]\n",
      "Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891, when the university first opened. In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.[199] However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.[200] Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until Spring quarter of their freshman year.[201]\n",
      "As of 2016 Stanford had 31 Greek organizations, including 14 sororities and 16 fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations are housed (eight in University owned houses and one, Sigma Chi, in their own house [though the land is the University][202]). Six chapters were members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, 11 chapters were members of the Interfraternity Council, 7 chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and 6 chapters belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.[203]\n",
      "As of 2014 Stanford had 650 student organizations.[205] Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the University via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include \"special fees\", which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span from Athletic/Recreational (see section on Athletics), Careers/Pre-professional, Community Service, Ethnic/Cultural, Fraternities/Sororities, Health/Counseling, Media/Publications, Music/Dance/Creative Arts (see section on Arts), Political/Social Awareness to Religious/Philosophical.\n",
      "The Stanford Daily is the daily newspaper and has been published since the University was founded in 1892.[206] The Stanford Review is a conservative student newspaper founded in 1987.[207] The student-run radio station, KZSU Stanford 90.1 FM, features freeform music programming, sports commentary, and news segments; it started in 1947 as an AM radio station.[208]\n",
      "Students run SUpost.com, an online marketplace for Stanford students and alumni, in partnership with Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE) and the Stanford Pre-Business Association.[209] The latter is intended to build connections among industry, alumni, and student communities. Stanford Marketing is a student group that provides students hands on training through research and strategy consulting projects with Fortune 500 clients, as well as workshops led by people from industry and professors in the Stanford Graduate School of Business.[210][211] Stanford Finance provides mentoring and internships for students who want to enter a career in finance. The Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES), is one of the largest professional organizations in Silicon Valley, with over 5,000 members. Its goal is to support the next generation of entrepreneurs. Stanford Women In Business (SWIB) is an on-campus business organization consisting of over a board of 40 and 100 active members. Each year, SWIB organizes over 25 events and workshops, hosts a winter and spring conference, and provides mentorship and spring quarter internships. StartX is a non-profit startup accelerator for student and faculty-led startups[212] that over 12% of the study body has applied to. It is staffed primarily by students.\n",
      "Other groups include:\n",
      "Stanford's Department of Public Safety is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus. Its deputy sheriffs are peace officers by arrangement with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office.[221] The department is also responsible for publishing an annual crime report covering the previous three years as required by the Clery Act.[222] Fire protection has been provided by contract with the Palo Alto Fire Department since 1976.[223]\n",
      "Murder is rare on the campus though a few of the cases have been notorious including Theodore Streleski's murder of his professor in 1978 and the unsolved 1974 murder of Arlis Perry in Stanford Memorial Church.[224]\n",
      "In Stanford University's 2015 Campus Climate Survey, 4.7 percent of female undergraduates reported experiencing sexual assault as defined by the university and 32.9 percent reported experiencing sexual misconduct.[225] According to the survey, 85% of perpetrators of misconduct were Stanford students and 80% were men.[225] Perpetrators of sexual misconduct were frequently aided by alcohol or drugs, according to the survey: \"Nearly three-fourths of the students whose responses were categorized as sexual assault indicated that the act was accomplished by a person or person taking advantage of them when they were drunk or high, according to the survey. Close to 70 percent of students who reported an experience of sexual misconduct involving nonconsensual penetration and/or oral sex indicated the same.\"[225] Associated Students of Stanford University and student and alumni activists with the anti-rape group Stand with Leah criticized the survey methodology for downgrading incidents involving alcohol if students did not check two separate boxes indicating they were both intoxicated and incapacity while sexually assaulted.[225] Reporting on the Brock Turner rape case, a reporter from The Washington Post analyzed campus rape reports submitted by universities to the U.S. Department of Education, and found that Stanford was one of the top ten universities in campus rapes in 2014, with 26 reported that year, but when analyzed by rapes per 1000 students, Stanford was not among the top ten.[226]\n",
      "Early in the morning of January 18, 2015, a woman visiting campus to attend a party at the Kappa Alpha fraternity was raped by Brock Turner, a freshman who had a swimming scholarship. The rape was interrupted by two Swedish graduate students.[227] Stanford immediately referred the case to prosecutors and offered the woman counseling, and within two weeks had barred Turner from campus after conducting an investigation.[228] Turner was convicted on three felony charges in March 2016 and in June 2016 he received a jail sentence of six months and was declared a sex offender, requiring him to register as such for the rest of his life; prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence out of the maximum 14 years that was possible.[229] The case and the relatively lenient sentence drew nationwide attention.[230] The judge in the case, a Stanford graduate, faced a recall effort in the aftermath.[227]\n",
      "In February 2015, Elise Clougherty filed a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale.[231][232] Lonsdale and Clougherty entered into a relationship in the spring of 2012 when she was a junior and he was her mentor in a Stanford entrepreneurship course.[232] By the spring of 2013 Clougherty had broken off the relationship and filed charges at Stanford that Lonsdale had broken the Stanford policy against consensual relationships between students and faculty and that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her, which resulted in Lonsdale being banned from Stanford for 10 years.[232] Lonsdale challenged Stanford's finding that he had had sexually assaulted and harassed her and Stanford rescinded that finding and the campus ban in the fall of 2015.[233] Clougherty withdrew her suit that fall as well.[234]\n",
      "As of late 2014, Stanford had 2,118 tenure-line faculty, senior fellows, center fellows, and medical center faculty.[5]\n",
      "Stanford's current community of scholars includes:\n",
      "Stanford's faculty and former faculty includes 31 Nobel laureates,[5] as well as 19 recipients (22 if visiting professors and consulting professors included) of the Turing Award, the so-called \"Nobel Prize in computer science\", comprising one third of the awards given in its 44-year history. The university has 27 ACM fellows. It is also affiliated with 4 Gödel Prize winners, 4 Knuth Prize recipients, 10 IJCAI Computers and Thought Award winners, and about 15 Grace Murray Hopper Award winners for their work in the foundations of computer science. Stanford alumni have started many companies and, according to Forbes, has produced the second highest number of billionaires of all universities.[239][240][241]\n",
      "Eight Stanford alumni have won the Nobel Prize.[242][243] As of 2014, 114 Stanford students have been named Rhodes Scholars.[244]\n",

      "About Python\n",
      "Python is one of those rare languages which can claim to be both simple and powerful.  You will find yourself pleasantly surprised to see how easy it is to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax and structure of the language you are programming in.\n",
      "The official introduction to Python is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will discuss most of these features in more detail in the next section.\n",
      "Story behind the name\n",
      "Guido van Rossum, the creator of the Python language, named the language after the BBC show \"Monty\n",
      "Python's Flying Circus\". He doesn't particularly like snakes that kill animals for food by winding\n",
      "their long bodies around them and crushing them.\n",
      "Features of Python\n",
      "Simple\n",
      "Python is a simple and minimalistic language. Reading a good Python program feels almost like reading English, although very strict English! This pseudo-code nature of Python is one of its greatest strengths. It allows you to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the language itself.\n",
      "Easy to Learn\n",
      "As you will see, Python is extremely easy to get started with. Python has an extraordinarily simple syntax, as already mentioned.\n",
      "Free and Open Source\n",
      "Python is an example of a FLOSS (Free/Libré and Open Source Software). In simple terms, you can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code, make changes to it, and use pieces of it in new free programs. FLOSS is based on the concept of a community which shares knowledge. This is one of the reasons why Python is so good - it has been created and is constantly improved by a community who just want to see a better Python.\n",
      "High-level Language\n",
      "When you write programs in Python, you never need to bother about the low-level details such as managing the memory used by your program, etc.\n",
      "Portable\n",
      "Due to its open-source nature, Python has been ported to (i.e. changed to make it work on) many platforms. All your Python programs can work on any of these platforms without requiring any changes at all if you are careful enough to avoid any system-dependent features.\n",
      "You can use Python on GNU/Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400, BeOS, OS/390, z/OS, Palm OS, QNX, VMS, Psion, Acorn RISC OS, VxWorks, PlayStation, Sharp Zaurus, Windows CE and PocketPC!\n",
      "You can even use a platform like Kivy to create games for your computer and for iPhone, iPad, and Android.\n",
      "Interpreted\n",
      "This requires a bit of explanation.\n",
      "A program written in a compiled language like C or C++ is converted from the source language i.e. C or C++ into a language that is spoken by your computer (binary code i.e. 0s and 1s) using a compiler with various flags and options. When you run the program, the linker/loader software copies the program from hard disk to memory and starts running it.\n",
      "Python, on the other hand, does not need compilation to binary. You just run the program directly from the source code. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes and then translates this into the native language of your computer and then runs it. All this, actually, makes using Python much easier since you don't have to worry about compiling the program, making sure that the proper libraries are linked and loaded, etc. This also makes your Python programs much more portable, since you can just copy your Python program onto another computer and it just works!\n",
      "Object Oriented\n",
      "Python supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented programming. In procedure-oriented languages, the program is built around procedures or functions which are nothing but reusable pieces of programs. In object-oriented languages, the program is built around objects which combine data and functionality. Python has a very powerful but simplistic way of doing OOP, especially when compared to big languages like C++ or Java.\n",
      "Extensible\n",
      "If you need a critical piece of code to run very fast or want to have some piece of algorithm not to be open, you can code that part of your program in C or C++ and then use it from your Python program.\n",
      "Embeddable\n",
      "You can embed Python within your C/C++ programs to give scripting capabilities for your program's users.\n",
      "Extensive Libraries\n",
      "The Python Standard Library is huge indeed. It can help you do various things involving regular expressions,documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, FTP, email, XML, XML-RPC, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI (graphical user interfaces), and other system-dependent stuff. Remember, all this is always available wherever Python is installed. This is called the Batteries Included philosophy of Python.\n",
      "Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries which you can find at the Python Package Index.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "Python is indeed an exciting and powerful language. It has the right combination of performance and features that make writing programs in Python both fun and easy.\n",
      "Python 3 versus 2\n",
      "You can ignore this section if you're not interested in the difference between \"Python version 2\" and \"Python version 3\". But please do be aware of which version you are using. This book is written for Python version 3.\n",
      "Remember that once you have properly understood and learn to use one version, you can easily learn the differences and use the other one. The hard part is learning programming and understanding the basics of Python language itself. That is our goal in this book, and once you have achieved that goal, you can easily use Python 2 or Python 3 depending on your situation.\n",
      "For details on differences between Python 2 and Python 3, see:\n",
      "\n",
      "The future of Python 2\n",
      "Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3\n",
      "Writing code that runs under both Python2 and 3\n",
      "Supporting Python 3: An in-depth guide\n",
      "\n",
      "What Programmers Say\n",
      "You may find it interesting to read what great hackers like ESR have to say about Python:\n",
      "\n",
      "Eric S. Raymond is the author of \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\" and is also the person who coined the term Open Source. He says that Python has become his favorite programming language. This article was the real inspiration for my first brush with Python.\n",
      "Bruce Eckel is the author of the famous 'Thinking in Java' and 'Thinking in C++' books. He says that no language has made him more productive than Python. He says that Python is perhaps the only language that focuses on making things easier for the programmer. Read the complete interview for more details.\n",
      "Peter Norvig is a well-known Lisp author and Director of Search Quality at Google (thanks to Guido van Rossum for pointing that out). He says that writing Python is like writing in pseudocode. He says that Python has always been an integral part of Google. You can actually verify this statement by looking at the Google Jobs page which lists Python knowledge as a requirement for software engineers.\n",

      "Installation \n",
      "When we refer to \"Python 3\" in this book, we will be referring to any version of Python equal to or greater than version Python 3.5.1.\n",
      "Installation on Windows\n",
      "Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version. At the time of this writing, it was Python 3.5.1 \n",
      "The installation is just like any other Windows-based software.\n",
      "Note that if your Windows version is pre-Vista, you should download Python 3.4 only as later versions require newer versions of Windows.\n",
      "CAUTION: Make sure you check option Add Python 3.5 to PATH.\n",
      "To change install location, click on Customize installation, then Next and enter C:\\python35 as install location.\n",
      "If not checked, check Add Python to environment variables. This does the same thing as Add Python 3.5 to PATH on the first install screen.\n",
      "You can choose to install Launcher for all users or not, it does not matter much. Launcher is used to switch between different versions of Python installed.\n",
      "If your path was not set correctly, then follow these steps to fix it. Otherwise, go to Running Python prompt on Windows.\n",
      "NOTE: For people who already know programming, if you are familiar with Docker, check out Python in Docker and Docker on Windows.\n",
      "DOS Prompt \n",
      "If you want to be able to use Python from the Windows command line i.e. the DOS prompt, then you need to set the PATH variable appropriately.\n",
      "For Windows 2000, XP, 2003 , click on Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables. Click on the variable named PATH in the System Variables section, then select Edit and add ;C:\\Python35 (please verify that this folder exists, it will be different for newer versions of Python) to the end of what is already there. Of course, use the appropriate directory name.\n",

Click on Advanced system settings on the left and then click on the Advanced tab. At the bottom click on Environment Variables and under System variables, look for the PATH variable, select and then press Edit.\n",
      "Go to the end of the line under Variable value and append ;C:\\Python35 (please verify that this folder exists, it will be different for newer versions of Python) to the end of what is already there. Of course, use the appropriate folder name.\n",
      "If the value was %SystemRoot%\\system32; It will now become %SystemRoot%\\system32;C:\\Python35 \n",
      "Click OK and you are done. No restart is required, however you may have to close and reopen the command line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Running Python prompt on Windows\n",
      "For Windows users, you can run the interpreter in the command line if you have set the PATH variable appropriately.\n",
      "To open the terminal in Windows, click the start button and click Run. In the dialog box, type cmd and press [enter] key.\n",
      "Then, type python and ensure there are no errors.\n",
      "Installation on Mac OS X\n",
      "For Mac OS X users, use Homebrew: brew install python3.\n",
      "To verify, open the terminal by pressing [Command + Space] keys (to open Spotlight search), type Terminal and press [enter] key. Now, run python3 and ensure there are no errors.\n",
      "Installation on GNU/Linux\n",
      "For GNU/Linux users, use your distribution's package manager to install Python 3, e.g. on Debian & Ubuntu: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3.\n",
      "To verify, open the terminal by opening the Terminal application or by pressing Alt + F2 and entering gnome-terminal. If that doesn't work, please refer the documentation of your particular GNU/Linux distribution. Now, run python3 and ensure there are no errors.\n",
      "You can see the version of Python on the screen by running:\n",
      "\n",
      "$ python3 -V\n",
      "Python 3.5.1\n",
      "NOTE: $ is the prompt of the shell. It will be different for you depending on the settings of the operating system on your computer, hence I will indicate the prompt by just the $ symbol.\n",
      "CAUTION: Output may be different on your computer, depending on the version of Python software installed on your computer.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "From now on, we will assume that you have Python installed on your system.\n",
      "Next, we will write our first Python program.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First Steps\n",
      "We will now see how to run a traditional 'Hello World' program in Python. This will teach you how to write, save and run Python programs.\n",
      "There are two ways of using Python to run your program - using the interactive interpreter prompt or using a source file. We will now see how to use both of these methods.\n",
      "Using The Interpreter Prompt\n",
      "Open the terminal in your operating system (as discussed previously in the Installation chapter) and then open the Python prompt by typing python3 and pressing [enter] key.\n",
      "Once you have started Python, you should see >>> where you can start typing stuff. This is called the Python interpreter prompt.\n",
      "At the Python interpreter prompt, type:\n",
      "print(\"Hello World\")\n",
      "\n",
      "followed by the [enter] key. You should see the words Hello World printed to the screen.\n",
      "Here is an example of what you should be seeing, when using a Mac OS X computer. The details about the Python software will differ based on your computer, but the part from the prompt (i.e. from >>> onwards) should be the same regardless of the operating system.\n",
      "\n",
      "> python3\n",
      "Python 3.5.1 (default, Jan 14 2016, 06:54:11)\n",

      ">>> print(\"Hello World\")\n",
      "Hello World\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that Python gives you the output of the line immediately! What you just entered is a single Python statement. We use print to (unsurprisingly) print any value that you supply to it. Here, we are supplying the text Hello World and this is promptly printed to the screen.\n",
      "How to Quit the Interpreter Prompt\n",
      "If you are using a GNU/Linux or OS X shell, you can exit the interpreter prompt by pressing [ctrl + d] or entering exit() (note: remember to include the parentheses, ()) followed by the [enter] key.\n",
      "If you are using the Windows command prompt, press [ctrl + z] followed by the [enter] key.\n",
      "Choosing An Editor\n",
      "We cannot type out our program at the interpreter prompt every time we want to run something, so we have to save them in files and can run our programs any number of times.\n",
      "To create our Python source files, we need an editor software where you can type and save. A good programmer's editor will make your life easier in writing the source files. Hence, the choice of an editor is crucial indeed. You have to choose an editor as you would choose a car you would buy. A good editor will help you write Python programs easily, making your journey more comfortable and helps you reach your destination (achieve your goal) in a much faster and safer way.\n",
      "One of the very basic requirements is syntax highlighting where all the different parts of your Python program are colorized so that you can see your program and visualize its running.\n",
      "If you have no idea where to start, I would recommend using PyCharm Educational Edition software which is available on Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux. Details in the next section.\n",
      "If you are using Windows, do not use Notepad - it is a bad choice because it does not do syntax highlighting and also importantly it does not support indentation of the text which is very important in our case as we will see later. Good editors will automatically do this.\n",
      "If you are an experienced programmer, then you must be already using Vim or Emacs. Needless to say, these are two of the most powerful editors and you will benefit from using them to write your Python programs. I personally use both for most of my programs, and have even written an entire book on Vim.\n",
      "In case you are willing to take the time to learn Vim or Emacs, then I highly recommend that you do learn to use either of them as it will be very useful for you in the long run. However, as I mentioned before, beginners can start with PyCharm and focus the learning on Python rather than the editor at this moment.\n",
      "To reiterate, please choose a proper editor - it can make writing Python programs more fun and easy.\n",
      "PyCharm \n",
      "PyCharm Educational Edition is a free editor which you can use for writing Python programs.\n",
      "When you open PyCharm, you'll see this, click on Create New Project:\n",

      "\n",
      "print(\"hello world\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Now right-click on what you typed (without selecting the text), and click on Run 'hello'.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should now see the output (what it prints) of your program:\n",
      "\n",
      "Phew! That was quite a few steps to get started, but henceforth, every time we ask you to create a new file, remember to just right-click on helloworld on the left -> New -> Python File and continue the same steps to type and run as shown above.\n",
      "You can find more information about PyCharm in the PyCharm Quickstart page.\n",
      "Vim\n",
      "\n",
      "Install Vim\n",
      "Mac OS X users should install macvim package via HomeBrew\n",
      "Windows users should download the \"self-installing executable\" from Vim website\n",
      "GNU/Linux users should get Vim from their distribution's software repositories, e.g. Debian and Ubuntu users can install the vim package.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Install jedi-vim plugin for autocompletion.\n",
      "Install corresponding jedi python package : pip install -U jedi\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Install ELPY\n",
      "\n",
      "Using A Source File\n",
      "Now let's get back to programming. There is a tradition that whenever you learn a new programming language, the first program that you write and run is the 'Hello World' program - all it does is just say 'Hello World' when you run it. As Simon Cozens1 says, it is the \"traditional incantation to the programming gods to help you learn the language better.\"\n",
      "Start your choice of editor, enter the following program and save it as hello.py.\n",
      "If you are using PyCharm, we have already discussed how to run from a source file.\n",
      "For other editors, open a new file hello.py and type this:\n",
      "print(\"hello world\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Where should you save the file? To any folder for which you know the location of the folder. If you\n",
      "don't understand what that means, create a new folder and use that location to save and run all\n",
      "your Python programs:\n",
      "\n",
      "/tmp/py on Mac OS X\n",
      "/tmp/py on GNU/Linux\n",
      "C:\\py on Windows\n",
      "\n",
      "To create the above folder (for the operating system you are using), use the mkdir command in the terminal, for example, mkdir /tmp/py.\n",
      "IMPORTANT: Always ensure that you give it the file extension of .py, for example, foo.py.\n",
      "To run your Python program:\n",
      "\n",
      "Open a terminal window (see the previous Installation chapter on how to do that)\n",
      "Change directory to where you saved the file, for example, cd /tmp/py\n",
      "Run the program by entering the command python hello.py. The output is as shown below.\n",
      "\n",
      "$ python hello.py\n",
      "hello world\n",
      "\n",
      "If you got the output as shown above, congratulations! - you have successfully run your first Python program. You have successfully crossed the hardest part of learning programming, which is, getting started with your first program!\n",
      "In case you got an error, please type the above program exactly as shown above and run the program again. Note that Python is case-sensitive i.e. print is not the same as Print - note the lowercase p in the former and the uppercase P in the latter. Also, ensure there are no spaces or tabs before the first character in each line - we will see why this is important later.\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "A Python program is composed of statements. In our first program, we have only one statement. In this statement, we call the print statement to which we supply the text \"hello world\".\n",
      "Getting Help\n",
      "If you need quick information about any function or statement in Python, then you can use the built-in help functionality. This is very useful especially when using the interpreter prompt. For example, run help('len') - this displays the help for the len function which is used to count number of items.\n",
      "TIP: Press q to exit the help.\n",
      "Similarly, you can obtain information about almost anything in Python. Use help() to learn more about using help itself!\n",
      "In case you need to get help for operators like return, then you need to put those inside quotes such as help('return') so that Python doesn't get confused on what we're trying to do.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "You should now be able to write, save and run Python programs at ease.\n",
      "Now that you are a Python user, let's learn some more Python concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. the author of the amazing 'Beginning Perl' book ↩\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Basics\n",
      "Just printing hello world is not enough, is it? You want to do more than that - you want to take some input, manipulate it and get something out of it. We can achieve this in Python using constants and variables, and we'll learn some other concepts as well in this chapter.\n",
      "Comments\n",
      "Comments are any text to the right of the # symbol and is mainly useful as notes for the reader of the program.\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "print('hello world') # Note that print is a function\n",
      "\n",
      "or:\n",
      "# Note that print is a function\n",
      "print('hello world')\n",
      "\n",
      "Use as many useful comments as you can in your program to:\n",
      "\n",
      "explain assumptions\n",
      "explain important decisions\n",
      "explain important details\n",
      "explain problems you're trying to solve\n",
      "explain problems you're trying to overcome in your program, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Code tells you how, comments should tell you why.\n",
      "This is useful for readers of your program so that they can easily understand what the program is doing. Remember, that person can be yourself after six months!\n",
      "Literal Constants\n",
      "An example of a literal constant is a number like 5, 1.23, or a string like 'This is a string' or \"It's a string!\".\n",
      "It is called a literal because it is literal - you use its value literally. The number 2 always represents itself and nothing else - it is a constant because its value cannot be changed. Hence, all these are referred to as literal constants.\n",
      "Numbers\n",
      "Numbers are mainly of two types - integers and floats.\n",
      "An example of an integer is 2 which is just a whole number.\n",
      "Examples of floating point numbers (or floats for short) are 3.23 and 52.3E-4. The E notation indicates powers of 10. In this case, 52.3E-4 means 52.3 * 10^-4^.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note for Experienced Programmers\n",
      "There is no separate long type. The int type can be an integer of any size.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strings\n",
      "A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are basically just a bunch of words.\n",
      "You will be using strings in almost every Python program that you write, so pay attention to the following part.\n",
      "Single Quote\n",
      "You can specify strings using single quotes such as 'Quote me on this'.\n",
      "All white space i.e. spaces and tabs, within the quotes, are preserved as-is.\n",
      "Double Quotes\n",
      "Strings in double quotes work exactly the same way as strings in single quotes. An example is \"What's your name?\".\n",
      "Triple Quotes \n",
      "You can specify multi-line strings using triple quotes - (\"\"\" or '''). You can use single quotes and double quotes freely within the triple quotes. An example is:\n",
      "'''This is a multi-line string. This is the first line.\n",
      "This is the second line.\n",
      "\"What's your name?,\" I asked.\n",
      "He said \"Bond, James Bond.\"\n",
      "'''\n",
      "\n",
      "Strings Are Immutable\n",
      "This means that once you have created a string, you cannot change it. Although this might seem like\n",
      "a bad thing, it really isn't. We will see why this is not a limitation in the various programs that\n",

      "Sometimes we may want to construct strings from other information. This is where the format() method is useful.\n",
      "Save the following lines as a file str_format.py:\n",
      "age = 20\n",
      "name = 'Swaroop'\n",
      "\n",

      "How It Works\n",
      "A string can use certain specifications and subsequently, the format method can be called to substitute those specifications with corresponding arguments to the format method.\n",
      "Observe the first usage where we use {0} and this corresponds to the variable name which is the first argument to the format method. Similarly, the second specification is {1} corresponding to age which is the second argument to the format method. Note that Python starts counting from 0 which means that first position is at index 0, second position is at index 1, and so on.\n",
      "Notice that we could have achieved the same using string concatenation:\n",
      "name + ' is ' + str(age) + ' years old'\n",
      "\n",
      "but that is much uglier and error-prone. Second, the conversion to string would be done automatically by the format method instead of the explicit conversion to strings needed in this case. Third, when using the format method, we can change the message without having to deal with the variables used and vice-versa.\n",
      "Also note that the numbers are optional, so you could have also written as:\n",
      "age = 20\n",
      "name = 'Swaroop'\n",
      "\n",
      "print('{} was {} years old when he wrote this book'.format(name, age))\n",
      "print('Why is {} playing with that python?'.format(name))\n",
      "\n",
      "which will give the same exact output as the previous program.\n",
      "What Python does in the format method is that it substitutes each argument value into the place of the specification. There can be more detailed specifications such as:\n",
      "# decimal (.) precision of 3 for float '0.333'\n",
      "print('{0:.3f}'.format(1.0/3))\n",
      "# fill with underscores (_) with the text centered\n",
      "# (^) to 11 width '___hello___'\n",
      "print('{0:_^11}'.format('hello'))\n",

      "Output:\n",
      "0.333\n",
      "___hello___\n",
      "Swaroop wrote A Byte of Python\n",
      "Since we are discussing formatting, note that print always ends with an invisible \"new line\" character (\\n) so that repeated calls to print will all print on a separate line each. To prevent this newline character from being printed, you can specify that it should end with a blank:\n",
      "print('a', end='')\n",
      "print('b', end='')\n",
      "\n",
      "Output is:\n",

      "print('b', end=' ')\n",
      "print('c')\n",
      "\n",
      "Output is:\n",
      "a b c\n",
      "Escape Sequences\n",
      "Suppose, you want to have a string which contains a single quote ('), how will you specify this string? For example, the string is \"What's your name?\". You cannot specify 'What's your name?' because Python will be confused as to where the string starts and ends. So, you will have to specify that this single quote does not indicate the end of the string. This can be done with the help of what is called an escape sequence. You specify the single quote as \\' : notice the backslash. Now, you can specify the string as 'What\\'s your name?'.\n",
      "Another way of specifying this specific string would be \"What's your name?\" i.e. using double quotes. Similarly, you have to use an escape sequence for using a double quote itself in a double quoted string. Also, you have to indicate the backslash itself using the escape sequence \\\\.\n",
      "What if you wanted to specify a two-line string? One way is to use a triple-quoted string as shown previously or you can use an escape sequence for the newline character - \\n to indicate the start of a new line. An example is:\n",
      "'This is the first line\\nThis is the second line'\n",
      "\n",
      "Another useful escape sequence to know is the tab: \\t. There are many more escape sequences but I have mentioned only the most useful ones here.\n",
      "One thing to note is that in a string, a single backslash at the end of the line indicates that the string is continued in the next line, but no newline is added. For example:\n",
      "\"This is the first sentence. \\\n",
      "This is the second sentence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "is equivalent to\n",
      "\"This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Raw String\n",
      "If you need to specify some strings where no special processing such as escape sequences are handled, then what you need is to specify a raw string by prefixing r or R to the string. An example is:\n",
      "r\"Newlines are indicated by \\n\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Note for Regular Expression Users\n",

      "\n",
      "Variable\n",
      "Using just literal constants can soon become boring - we need some way of storing any information and manipulate them as well. This is where variables come into the picture. Variables are exactly what the name implies - their value can vary, i.e., you can store anything using a variable. Variables are just parts of your computer's memory where you store some information. Unlike literal constants, you need some method of accessing these variables and hence you give them names.\n",
      "Identifier Naming\n",
      "Variables are examples of identifiers. Identifiers are names given to identify something. There are some rules you have to follow for naming identifiers:\n",
      "\n",
      "The first character of the identifier must be a letter of the alphabet (uppercase ASCII or lowercase ASCII or Unicode character) or an underscore (_).\n",
      "The rest of the identifier name can consist of letters (uppercase ASCII or lowercase ASCII or Unicode character), underscores (_) or digits (0-9).\n",
      "Identifier names are case-sensitive. For example, myname and myName are not the same. Note the lowercase n in the former and the uppercase N in the latter.\n",
      "Examples of valid identifier names are i, name_2_3. Examples of invalid identifier names are 2things, this is spaced out, my-name and >a1b2_c3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Types\n",
      "Variables can hold values of different types called data types. The basic types are numbers and strings, which we have already discussed. In later chapters, we will see how to create our own types using classes.\n",
      "Object\n",
      "Remember, Python refers to anything used in a program as an object.  This is meant in the generic sense. Instead of saying \"the something\"', we say \"the object\".\n",

      "6\n",
      "This is a multi-line string.\n",
      "This is the second line.\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "Here's how this program works. First, we assign the literal constant value 5 to the variable i using the assignment operator (=). This line is called a statement because it states that something should be done and in this case, we connect the variable name i to the value 5. Next, we print the value of i using the print statement which, unsurprisingly, just prints the value of the variable to the screen.\n",
      "Then we add 1 to the value stored in i and store it back. We then print it and expectedly, we get the value 6.\n",
      "Similarly, we assign the literal string to the variable s and then print it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note for static language programmers\n",
      "Variables are used by just assigning them a value. No declaration or data type definition is needed/used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Logical And Physical Line\n",
      "A physical line is what you see when you write the program. A logical line is what Python sees as a single statement. Python implicitly assumes that each physical line corresponds to a logical line.\n",
      "An example of a logical line is a statement like print 'hello world' - if this was on a line by itself (as you see it in an editor), then this also corresponds to a physical line.\n",
      "Implicitly, Python encourages the use of a single statement per line which makes code more readable.\n",
      "If you want to specify more than one logical line on a single physical line, then you have to explicitly specify this using a semicolon (;) which indicates the end of a logical line/statement. For example:\n",
      "i = 5\n",
      "print(i)\n",
      "\n",
      "is effectively same as\n",
      "i = 5;\n",
      "print(i);\n",
      "\n",
      "which is also same as\n",
      "i = 5; print(i);\n",
      "\n",
      "and same as\n",
      "i = 5; print(i)\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I strongly recommend that you stick to writing a maximum of a single logical line on each single physical line. The idea is that you should never use the semicolon. In fact, I have never used or even seen a semicolon in a Python program.\n",
      "There is one kind of situation where this concept is really useful: if you have a long line of code, you can break it into multiple physical lines by using the backslash. This is referred to as explicit line joining:\n",
      "s = 'This is a string. \\\n",
      "This continues the string.'\n",
      "print(s)\n",
      "\n",
      "Output:\n",
      "This is a string. This continues the string.\n",
      "Similarly,\n",
      "i = \\\n",
      "5\n",
      "\n",
      "is the same as\n",
      "i = 5\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, there is an implicit assumption where you don't need to use a backslash. This is the case where the logical line has a starting parentheses, starting square brackets or a starting curly braces but not an ending one. This is called implicit line joining. You can see this in action when we write programs using list in later chapters.\n",
      "Indentation\n",
      "Whitespace is important in Python. Actually, whitespace at the beginning of the line is important. This is called indentation. Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of the logical line is used to determine the indentation level of the logical line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.\n",
      "This means that statements which go together must have the same indentation. Each such set of statements is called a block. We will see examples of how blocks are important in later chapters.\n",
      "One thing you should remember is that wrong indentation can give rise to errors. For example:\n",
      "i = 5\n",
      "# Error below! Notice a single space at the start of the line\n",
      " print('Value is', i)\n",
      "print('I repeat, the value is', i)\n",
      "\n",
      "When you run this, you get the following error:\n",
      "  File \"whitespace.py\", line 3\n",
      "    print('Value is', i)\n",
      "    ^\n",
      "IndentationError: unexpected indent\n",
      "Notice that there is a single space at the beginning of the second line. The error indicated by Python tells us that the syntax of the program is invalid i.e. the program was not properly written. What this means to you is that you cannot arbitrarily start new blocks of statements (except for the default main block which you have been using all along, of course). Cases where you can use new blocks will be detailed in later chapters such as the control flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to indent\n",
      "Use four spaces for indentation. This is the official Python language recommendation. Good editors will automatically do this for you. Make sure you use a consistent number of spaces for indentation, otherwise your program will not run or will have unexpected behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Note to static language programmers\n",
      "Python will always use indentation for blocks and will never use braces. Run from __future__ import braces to learn more.\n",

      "Operators and Expressions \n",
      "Most statements (logical lines) that you write will contain expressions. A simple example of an expression is 2 + 3. An expression can be broken down into operators and operands.\n",
      "Operators are functionality that do something and can be represented by symbols such as + or by special keywords. Operators require some data to operate on and such data is called operands. In this case, 2 and 3 are the operands.\n",

      "We will briefly take a look at the operators and their usage.\n",
      "Note that you can evaluate the expressions given in the examples using the interpreter interactively. For example, to test the expression 2 + 3, use the interactive Python interpreter prompt:\n",

      "To make the expressions more readable, we can use parentheses. For example, 2 + (3 * 4) is definitely easier to understand than 2 + 3 * 4 which requires knowledge of the operator precedences. As with everything else, the parentheses should be used reasonably (do not overdo it) and should not be redundant, as in (2 + (3 * 4)).\n",
      "There is an additional advantage to using parentheses - it helps us to change the order of evaluation. For example, if you want addition to be evaluated before multiplication in an expression, then you can write something like (2 + 3) * 4.\n",
      "Associativity\n",
      "Operators are usually associated from left to right. This means that operators with the same precedence are evaluated in a left to right manner. For example, 2 + 3 + 4 is evaluated as (2 + 3) + 4.\n",

We store the result of the expression length * breadth in the variable area and then print it using the print function. In the second case, we directly use the value of the expression 2 * (length + breadth) in the print function.\n",
      "Also, notice how Python pretty-prints the output. Even though we have not specified a space between 'Area is' and the variable area, Python puts it for us so that we get a clean nice output and the program is much more readable this way (since we don't need to worry about spacing in the strings we use for output). This is an example of how Python makes life easy for the programmer.\n",

For example, you want the program to take some decisions and do different things depending on different situations, such as printing 'Good Morning' or 'Good Evening' depending on the time of the day?\n",

      "In this program, we take guesses from the user and check if it is the number that we have. We set the variable number to any integer we want, say 23. Then, we take the user's guess using the input() function. Functions are just reusable pieces of programs. We'll read more about them in the next chapter.\n",
      "We supply a string to the built-in input function which prints it to the screen and waits for input from the user. Once we enter something and press kbd:[enter] key, the input() function returns what we entered, as a string. We then convert this string to an integer using int and then store it in the variable guess. Actually, the int is a class but all you need to know right now is that you can use it to convert a string to an integer (assuming the string contains a valid integer in the text).\n",
      "Next, we compare the guess of the user with the number we have chosen. If they are equal, we print a success message. Notice that we use indentation levels to tell Python which statements belong to which block. This is why indentation is so important in Python. I hope you are sticking to the \"consistent indentation\" rule. Are you?\n",
      "Notice how the if statement contains a colon at the end - we are indicating to Python that a block of statements follows.\n",
      "Then, we check if the guess is less than the number, and if so, we inform the user that they must guess a little higher than that. What we have used here is the elif clause which actually combines two related if else-if else statements into one combined if-elif-else statement. This makes the program easier and reduces the amount of indentation required.\n",
      "The elif and else statements must also have a colon at the end of the logical line followed by their corresponding block of statements (with proper indentation, of course)\n",
      "You can have another if statement inside the if-block of an if statement and so on - this is called a nested if statement.\n",
      "Remember that the elif and else parts are optional. A minimal valid if statement is:\n",
      "if True:\n",
      "    print('Yes, it is true')\n",
      "\n",
      "After Python has finished executing the complete if statement along with the associated elif and else clauses, it moves on to the next statement in the block containing the if statement. In this case, it is the main block (where execution of the program starts), and the next statement is the print('Done') statement. After this, Python sees the ends of the program and simply finishes up.\n",
      "Even though this is a very simple program, I have been pointing out a lot of things that you should notice. All these are pretty straightforward (and surprisingly simple for those of you from C/C++ backgrounds). You will need to become aware of all these things initially, but after some practice you will become comfortable with them, and it will all feel 'natural' to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note for C/C++ Programmers\n",

      "The while Statement\n",
      "The while statement allows you to repeatedly execute a block of statements as long as a condition is true. A while statement is an example of what is called a looping statement. A while statement can have an optional else clause.\n",

      "In this program, we are still playing the guessing game, but the advantage is that the user is allowed to keep guessing until he guesses correctly - there is no need to repeatedly run the program for each guess, as we have done in the previous section. This aptly demonstrates the use of the while statement.\n",
      "We move the input and if statements to inside the while loop and set the variable running to True before the while loop. First, we check if the variable running is True and then proceed to execute the corresponding while-block. After this block is executed, the condition is again checked which in this case is the running variable. If it is true, we execute the while-block again, else we continue to execute the optional else-block and then continue to the next statement.\n",
      "The else block is executed when the while loop condition becomes False - this may even be the first time that the condition is checked. If there is an else clause for a while loop, it is always executed unless you break out of the loop with a break statement.\n",
      "The True and False are called Boolean types and you can consider them to be equivalent to the value 1 and 0 respectively.\n",

      "The for..in statement is another looping statement which iterates over a sequence of objects i.e. go through each item in a sequence. We will see more about sequences in detail in later chapters. What you need to know right now is that a sequence is just an ordered collection of items.\n",

      "How It Works\n",
      "In this program, we are printing a sequence of numbers. We generate this sequence of numbers using the built-in range function.\n",
      "What we do here is supply it two numbers and range returns a sequence of numbers starting from the first number and up to the second number. For example, range(1,5) gives the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4]. By default, range takes a step count of 1. If we supply a third number to range, then that becomes the step count. For example, range(1,5,2) gives [1,3]. Remember that the range extends up to the second number i.e. it does not include the second number.\n",
      "Note that range() generates only one number at a time, if you want the full list of numbers, call list() on the range(), for example, list(range(5)) will result in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Lists are explained in the data structures chapter.\n",
      "The for loop then iterates over this range - for i in range(1,5) is equivalent to for i in [1, 2, 3, 4] which is like assigning each number (or object) in the sequence to i, one at a time, and then executing the block of statements for each value of i.  In this case, we just print the value in the block of statements.\n",
      "Remember that the else part is optional. When included, it is always executed once after the for loop is over unless a break statement is encountered.\n",
      "Remember that the for..in loop works for any sequence. Here, we have a list of numbers generated by the built-in range function, but in general we can use any kind of sequence of any kind of objects! We will explore this idea in detail in later chapters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note for C/C++/Java/C# Programmers\n",
      "The Python for loop is radically different from the C/C++ for loop. C# programmers will note that the for loop in Python is similar to the foreach loop in C#. Java programmers will note that the same is similar to for (int i : IntArray) in Java 1.5.\n",
      "In C/C++, if you want to write for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++), then in Python you write just for i in range(0,5). As you can see, the for loop is simpler, more expressive and less error prone in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "The break Statement \n",
      "The break statement is used to break out of a loop statement i.e. stop the execution of a looping statement, even if the loop condition has not become False or the sequence of items has not been completely iterated over.\n",
      "An important note is that if you break out of a for or while loop, any corresponding loop else block is not executed.\n",

In the second case, we call the function with variables as arguments. print_max(x, y) causes the value of argument x to be assigned to parameter a and the value of argument y to be assigned to parameter b.

      "Local Variables\n",
      "When you declare variables inside a function definition, they are not related in any way to other variables with the same names used outside the function - i.e. variable names are local to the function.

      "Next, we assign the value 2 to x. The name x is local to our function.  So, when we change the value of x in the function, the x defined in the main block remains unaffected.\n",
      "With the last print statement, we display the value of x as defined in the main block, thereby confirming that it is actually unaffected by the local assignment within the previously called function.\n",
      "The global statement \n",
      "If you want to assign a value to a name defined at the top level of the program (i.e. not inside any kind of scope such as functions or classes), then you have to tell Python that the name is not local, but it is global. We do this using the global statement. It is impossible to assign a value to a variable defined outside a function without the global statement.\n",
      "You can use the values of such variables defined outside the function (assuming there is no variable with the same name within the function). However, this is not encouraged and should be avoided since it becomes unclear to the reader of the program as to where that variable's definition is. Using the global statement makes it amply clear that the variable is defined in an outermost block.\n",

      "How It Works\n",
      "The global statement is used to declare that x is a global variable - hence, when we assign a value to x inside the function, that change is reflected when we use the value of x in the main block.\n",
      "You can specify more than one global variable using the same global statement e.g. global x, y, z.\n",
      "Default Argument Values \n",
      "For some functions, you may want to make some parameters optional and use default values in case the user does not want to provide values for them. This is done with the help of default argument values. You can specify default argument values for parameters by appending to the parameter name in the function definition the assignment operator (=) followed by the default value.\n",
      "Note that the default argument value should be a constant. More precisely, the default argument value should be immutable - this is explained in detail in later chapters. For now, just remember this.\n",
      "Example (save as function_default.py):\n",

      "$ python function_default.py\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "WorldWorldWorldWorldWorld\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "The function named say is used to print a string as many times as specified. If we don't supply a value, then by default, the string is printed just once. We achieve this by specifying a default argument value of 1 to the parameter times.\n",
      "In the first usage of say, we supply only the string and it prints the string once. In the second usage of say, we supply both the string and an argument 5 stating that we want to say the string message 5 times.\n",
      "\n",
      "CAUTION\n",
      "Only those parameters which are at the end of the parameter list can be given default argument\n",
      "values i.e. you cannot have a parameter with a default argument value preceding a parameter without\n",
      "a default argument value in the function's parameter list.\n",
      "This is because the values are assigned to the parameters by position. For example,def func(a,\n",
      "b=5) is valid, but def func(a=5, b) is not valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keyword Arguments\n",
      "If you have some functions with many parameters and you want to specify only some of them, then you can give values for such parameters by naming them - this is called keyword arguments - we use the name (keyword) instead of the position (which we have been using all along) to specify the arguments to the function.\n",
      "There are two advantages - one, using the function is easier since we do not need to worry about the order of the arguments. Two, we can give values to only those parameters to which we want to, provided that the other parameters have default argument values.\n",
      "Example (save as function_keyword.py):\n",
      "def func(a, b=5, c=10):\n",
      "    print('a is', a, 'and b is', b, 'and c is', c)\n",

      "a is 100 and b is 5 and c is 50\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "The function named func has one parameter without a default argument value, followed by two parameters with default argument values.\n",
      "In the first usage, func(3, 7), the parameter a gets the value 3, the parameter b gets the value 7 and c gets the default value of 10.\n",
      "In the second usage func(25, c=24), the variable a gets the value of 25 due to the position of the argument. Then, the parameter c gets the value of 24 due to naming i.e. keyword arguments. The variable b gets the default value of 5.\n",
      "In the third usage func(c=50, a=100), we use keyword arguments for all specified values. Notice that we are specifying the value for parameter c before that for a even though a is defined before c in the function definition.\n",
      "VarArgs parameters\n",
      "Sometimes you might want to define a function that can take any number of parameters, i.e. variable number of arguments, this can be achieved by using the stars (save as function_varargs.py):\n",

      "How It Works\n",
      "When we declare a starred parameter such as *param, then all the positional arguments from that point till the end are collected as a tuple called 'param'.\n",
      "Similarly, when we declare a double-starred parameter such as **param, then all the keyword arguments from that point till the end are collected as a dictionary called 'param'.\n",
      "We will explore tuples and dictionaries in a later chapter.\n",
      "The return statement \n",
      "The return statement is used to return from a function i.e. break out of the function. We can optionally return a value from the function as well.\n",
      "Example (save as function_return.py):\n",
      "def maximum(x, y):\n",
      "    if x > y:\n",
      "        return x\n",
      "    elif x == y:\n",
      "        return 'The numbers are equal'\n",

      "Output:\n",
      "$ python function_return.py\n",
      "3\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "The maximum function returns the maximum of the parameters, in this case the numbers supplied to the function. It uses a simple if..else statement to find the greater value and then returns that value.\n",
      "Note that a return statement without a value is equivalent to return None. None is a special type in Python that represents nothingness. For example, it is used to indicate that a variable has no value if it has a value of None.\n",
      "Every function implicitly contains a return None statement at the end unless you have written your own return statement. You can see this by running print(some_function()) where the function some_function does not use the return statement such as:\n",
      "def some_function():\n",
      "    pass\n",
      "\n",
      "The pass statement is used in Python to indicate an empty block of statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "TIP: There is a built-in function called max that already implements the 'find maximum' functionality, so use this built-in function whenever possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "DocStrings\n",
      "Python has a nifty feature called documentation strings, usually referred to by its shorter name docstrings. DocStrings are an important tool that you should make use of since it helps to document the program better and makes it easier to understand. Amazingly, we can even get the docstring back from, say a function, when the program is actually running!\n",
      "Example (save as function_docstring.py):\n",
      "def print_max(x, y):\n",
      "    '''Prints the maximum of two numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The two values must be integers.'''\n",
      "    # convert to integers, if possible\n",
      "    x = int(x)\n",
      "    y = int(y)\n",

      "Prints the maximum of two numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The two values must be integers.\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "A string on the first logical line of a function is the docstring for that function. Note that DocStrings also apply to modules and classes which we will learn about in the respective chapters.\n",
      "The convention followed for a docstring is a multi-line string where the first line starts with a capital letter and ends with a dot. Then the second line is blank followed by any detailed explanation starting from the third line. You are strongly advised to follow this convention for all your docstrings for all your non-trivial functions.\n",
      "We can access the docstring of the print_max function using the __doc__ (notice the double underscores) attribute (name belonging to) of the function. Just remember that Python treats everything as an object and this includes functions. We'll learn more about objects in the chapter on classes.\n",
      "If you have used help() in Python, then you have already seen the usage of docstrings! What it does is just fetch the __doc__ attribute of that function and displays it in a neat manner for you. You can try it out on the function above - just include help(print_max) in your program. Remember to press the q key to exit help.\n",
      "Automated tools can retrieve the documentation from your program in this manner. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you use docstrings for any non-trivial function that you write. The pydoc command that comes with your Python distribution works similarly to help() using docstrings.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "We have seen so many aspects of functions but note that we still haven't covered all aspects of them. However, we have already covered most of what you'll use regarding Python functions on an everyday basis.\n",
      "Next, we will see how to use as well as create Python modules.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Modules\n",
      "You have seen how you can reuse code in your program by defining functions once. What if you wanted to reuse a number of functions in other programs that you write? As you might have guessed, the answer is modules.\n",
      "There are various methods of writing modules, but the simplest way is to create a file with a .py extension that contains functions and variables.\n",
      "Another method is to write the modules in the native language in which the Python interpreter itself was written. For example, you can write modules in the C programming language and when compiled, they can be used from your Python code when using the standard Python interpreter.\n",
      "A module can be imported by another program to make use of its functionality. This is how we can use the Python standard library as well. First, we will see how to use the standard library modules.\n",
      "Example (save as module_using_sys.py):\n",
      "import sys\n",
      "\n",
      "print('The command line arguments are:')\n",
      "for i in sys.argv:\n",

      "we\n",
      "are\n",
      "arguments\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The PYTHONPATH is ['/tmp/py',\n",
      "# many entries here, not shown here\n",
      "'/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages',\n",
      "'/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages']\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "First, we import the sys module using the import statement. Basically, this translates to us telling Python that we want to use this module. The sys module contains functionality related to the Python interpreter and its environment i.e. the system.\n",
      "When Python executes the import sys statement, it looks for the sys module. In this case, it is one of the built-in modules, and hence Python knows where to find it.\n",
      "If it was not a compiled module i.e. a module written in Python, then the Python interpreter will search for it in the directories listed in its sys.path variable. If the module is found, then the statements in the body of that module are run and the module is made available for you to use. Note that the initialization is done only the first time that we import a module.\n",
      "The argv variable in the sys module is accessed using the dotted notation i.e. sys.argv. It clearly indicates that this name is part of the sys module. Another advantage of this approach is that the name does not clash with any argv variable used in your program.\n",
      "The sys.argv variable is a list of strings (lists are explained in detail in a later chapter. Specifically, the sys.argv contains the list of command line arguments i.e. the arguments passed to your program using the command line.\n",
      "If you are using an IDE to write and run these programs, look for a way to specify command line arguments to the program in the menus.\n",
      "Here, when we execute python module_using_sys.py we are arguments, we run the module module_using_sys.py with the python command and the other things that follow are arguments passed to the program. Python stores the command line arguments in the sys.argv variable for us to use.\n",
      "Remember, the name of the script running is always the first element in the sys.argv list. So, in this case we will have 'module_using_sys.py' as sys.argv[0], 'we' as sys.argv[1], 'are' as sys.argv[2] and 'arguments' as sys.argv[3]. Notice that Python starts counting from 0 and not 1.\n",
      "The sys.path contains the list of directory names where modules are imported from. Observe that the first string in sys.path is empty - this empty string indicates that the current directory is also part of the sys.path which is same as the PYTHONPATH environment variable. This means that you can directly import modules located in the current directory. Otherwise, you will have to place your module in one of the directories listed in sys.path.\n",
      "Note that the current directory is the directory from which the program is launched. Run import os; print(os.getcwd()) to find out the current directory of your program.\n",
      "Byte-compiled .pyc files \n",
      "Importing a module is a relatively costly affair, so Python does some tricks to make it faster. One way is to create byte-compiled files with the extension .pyc which is an intermediate form that Python transforms the program into (remember the introduction section on how Python works?). This .pyc file is useful when you import the module the next time from a different program - it will be much faster since a portion of the processing required in importing a module is already done. Also, these byte-compiled files are platform-independent.\n",
      "NOTE: These .pyc files are usually created in the same directory as the corresponding .py files. If Python does not have permission to write to files in that directory, then the .pyc files will not be created.\n",
      "The from..import statement \n",
      "If you want to directly import the argv variable into your program (to avoid typing the sys. everytime for it), then you can use the from sys import argv statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "WARNING: In general, avoid using the from..import statement, use the import statement instead. This is because your program will avoid name clashes and will be more readable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "from math import sqrt\n",
      "print(\"Square root of 16 is\", sqrt(16))\n",
      "\n",
      "A module's __name__ \n",
      "Every module has a name and statements in a module can find out the name of their module. This is handy for the particular purpose of figuring out whether the module is being run standalone or being imported. As mentioned previously, when a module is imported for the first time, the code it contains gets executed. We can use this to make the module behave in different ways depending on whether it is being used by itself or being imported from another module. This can be achieved using the __name__ attribute of the module.\n",
      "Example (save as module_using_name.py):\n",
      "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
      "    print('This program is being run by itself')\n",
      "else:\n",
      "    print('I am being imported from another module')\n",

      "I am being imported from another module\n",
      ">>>\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "Every Python module has its __name__ defined. If this is '__main__', that implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can take appropriate actions.\n",
      "Making Your Own Modules\n",
      "Creating your own modules is easy, you've been doing it all along!  This is because every Python program is also a module. You just have to make sure it has a .py extension. The following example should make it clear.\n",
      "Example (save as mymodule.py):\n",
      "def say_hi():\n",
      "    print('Hi, this is mymodule speaking.')\n",
      "\n",
      "__version__ = '0.1'\n",
      "\n",
      "The above was a sample module. As you can see, there is nothing particularly special about it compared to our usual Python program. We will next see how to use this module in our other Python programs.\n",
      "Remember that the module should be placed either in the same directory as the program from which we import it, or in one of the directories listed in sys.path.\n",
      "Another module (save as mymodule_demo.py):\n",
      "import mymodule\n",
      "\n",
      "mymodule.say_hi()\n",
      "print('Version', mymodule.__version__)\n",

      "Hi, this is mymodule speaking.\n",
      "Version 0.1\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "Notice that we use the same dotted notation to access members of the module. Python makes good reuse of the same notation to give the distinctive 'Pythonic' feel to it so that we don't have to keep learning new ways to do things.\n",
      "Here is a version utilising the from..import syntax (save as mymodule_demo2.py):\n",
      "from mymodule import say_hi, __version__\n",
      "\n",
      "say_hi()\n",
      "print('Version', __version__)\n",
      "\n",
      "The output of mymodule_demo2.py is same as the output of mymodule_demo.py.\n",
      "Notice that if there was already a __version__ name declared in the module that imports mymodule, there would be a clash. This is also likely because it is common practice for each module to declare it's version number using this name. Hence, it is always recommended to prefer the import statement even though it might make your program a little longer.\n",
      "You could also use:\n",
      "from mymodule import *\n",
      "\n",
      "This will import all public names such as say_hi but would not import __version__ because it starts with double underscores.\n",

      "The dir function \n",
      "Built-in dir() function returns list of names defined by an object.\n",
      "If the object is a module, this list includes functions, classes and variables, defined inside that module.\n",
      "This function can accept arguments.\n",
      "If the argument is the name of the module, function returns list of names from that specified module.\n",

      "['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', '__package__']\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "First, we see the usage of dir on the imported sys module. We can see the huge list of attributes that it contains.\n",
      "Next, we use the dir function without passing parameters to it. By default, it returns the list of attributes for the current module. Notice that the list of imported modules is also part of this list.\n",
      "In order to observe the dir in action, we define a new variable a and assign it a value and then check dir and we observe that there is an additional value in the list of the same name. We remove the variable/attribute of the current module using the del statement and the change is reflected again in the output of the dir function.\n",
      "A note on del - this statement is used to delete a variable/name and after the statement has run, in this case del a, you can no longer access the variable a - it is as if it never existed before at all.\n",
      "Note that the dir() function works on any object. For example, run dir(str) for the attributes of the str (string) class.\n",
      "There is also a vars() function which can potentially give you the attributes and their values, but it will not work for all cases.\n",
      "Packages\n",
      "By now, you must have started observing the hierarchy of organizing your programs. Variables usually go inside functions. Functions and global variables usually go inside modules. What if you wanted to organize modules? That's where packages come into the picture.\n",
      "Packages are just folders of modules with a special __init__.py file that indicates to Python that this folder is special because it contains Python modules.\n",
      "Let's say you want to create a package called 'world' with subpackages 'asia', 'africa', etc. and these subpackages in turn contain modules like 'india', 'madagascar', etc.\n",
      "This is how you would structure the folders:\n",
      "- <some folder present in the sys.path>/\n",
      "    - world/\n",
      "        - __init__.py\n",
      "        - asia/\n",

      "Summary\n",
      "Just like functions are reusable parts of programs, modules are reusable programs. Packages are another hierarchy to organize modules. The standard library that comes with Python is an example of such a set of packages and modules.\n",
      "We have seen how to use these modules and create our own modules.\n",
      "Next, we will learn about some interesting concepts called data structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Structures \n",
      "Data structures are basically just that - they are structures which can hold some data together. In other words, they are used to store a collection of related data.\n",
      "There are four built-in data structures in Python - list, tuple, dictionary and set. We will see how to use each of them and how they make life easier for us.\n",
      "List\n",
      "A list is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items i.e. you can store a sequence of items in a list. This is easy to imagine if you can think of a shopping list where you have a list of items to buy, except that you probably have each item on a separate line in your shopping list whereas in Python you put commas in between them.\n",
      "The list of items should be enclosed in square brackets so that Python understands that you are specifying a list. Once you have created a list, you can add, remove or search for items in the list. Since we can add and remove items, we say that a list is a mutable data type i.e. this type can be altered.\n",
      "Quick Introduction To Objects And Classes\n",
      "Although I've been generally delaying the discussion of objects and classes till now, a little explanation is needed right now so that you can understand lists better. We will explore this topic in detail in a later chapter.\n",
      "A list is an example of usage of objects and classes. When we use a variable i and assign a value to it, say integer 5 to it, you can think of it as creating an object (i.e. instance) i of class (i.e. type) int. In fact, you can read help(int) to understand this better.\n",
      "A class can also have methods i.e. functions defined for use with respect to that class only. You can use these pieces of functionality only when you have an object of that class. For example, Python provides an append method for the list class which allows you to add an item to the end of the list. For example, mylist.append('an item') will add that string to the list mylist. Note the use of dotted notation for accessing methods of the objects.\n",
      "A class can also have fields which are nothing but variables defined for use with respect to that class only. You can use these variables/names only when you have an object of that class. Fields are also accessed by the dotted notation, for example, mylist.field.\n",
      "Example (save as ds_using_list.py):\n",
      "# This is my shopping list\n",
      "shoplist = ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "print('These items are:', end=' ')\n",
      "for item in shoplist:\n",
      "    print(item, end=' ')\n",
      "\n",
      "print('\\nI also have to buy rice.')\n",
      "shoplist.append('rice')\n",
      "print('My shopping list is now', shoplist)\n",
      "\n",
      "print('I will sort my list now')\n",
      "shoplist.sort()\n",
      "print('Sorted shopping list is', shoplist)\n",
      "\n",
      "print('The first item I will buy is', shoplist[0])\n",
      "olditem = shoplist[0]\n",
      "del shoplist[0]\n",
      "print('I bought the', olditem)\n",

      "These items are: apple mango carrot banana\n",
      "I also have to buy rice.\n",

      "I bought the apple\n",
      "My shopping list is now ['banana', 'carrot', 'mango', 'rice']\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "The variable shoplist is a shopping list for someone who is going to the market. In shoplist, we only store strings of the names of the items to buy but you can add any kind of object to a list including numbers and even other lists.\n",
      "We have also used the for..in loop to iterate through the items of the list. By now, you must have realised that a list is also a sequence. The speciality of sequences will be discussed in a later section.\n",
      "Notice the use of the end parameter in the call to print function to indicate that we want to end the output with a space instead of the usual line break.\n",
      "Next, we add an item to the list using the append method of the list object, as already discussed before. Then, we check that the item has been indeed added to the list by printing the contents of the list by simply passing the list to the print function which prints it neatly.\n",
      "Then, we sort the list by using the sort method of the list. It is important to understand that this method affects the list itself and does not return a modified list - this is different from the way strings work. This is what we mean by saying that lists are mutable and that strings are immutable.\n",
      "Next, when we finish buying an item in the market, we want to remove it from the list. We achieve this by using the del statement. Here, we mention which item of the list we want to remove and the del statement removes it from the list for us.  We specify that we want to remove the first item from the list and hence we use del shoplist[0] (remember that Python starts counting from 0).\n",
      "If you want to know all the methods defined by the list object, see help(list) for details.\n",
      "Tuple\n",
      "Tuples are used to hold together multiple objects. Think of them as similar to lists, but without the extensive functionality that the list class gives you. One major feature of tuples is that they are immutable like strings i.e. you cannot modify tuples.\n",
      "Tuples are defined by specifying items separated by commas within an optional pair of parentheses.\n",
      "Tuples are usually used in cases where a statement or a user-defined function can safely assume that the collection of values i.e. the tuple of values used will not change.\n",
      "Example (save as ds_using_tuple.py):\n",
      "# I would recommend always using parentheses\n",
      "# to indicate start and end of tuple\n",
      "# even though parentheses are optional.\n",
      "# Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
      "zoo = ('python', 'elephant', 'penguin')\n",
      "print('Number of animals in the zoo is', len(zoo))\n",
      "\n",

      "Last animal brought from old zoo is penguin\n",
      "Number of animals in the new zoo is 5\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "The variable zoo refers to a tuple of items. We see that the len function can be used to get the length of the tuple. This also indicates that a tuple is a sequence as well.\n",
      "We are now shifting these animals to a new zoo since the old zoo is being closed. Therefore, the new_zoo tuple contains some animals which are already there along with the animals brought over from the old zoo. Back to reality, note that a tuple within a tuple does not lose its identity.\n",
      "We can access the items in the tuple by specifying the item's position within a pair of square brackets just like we did for lists. This is called the indexing operator. We access the third item in new_zoo by specifying new_zoo[2] and we access the third item within the third item in the new_zoo tuple by specifying new_zoo[2][2]. This is pretty simple once you've understood the idiom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuple with 0 or 1 items\n",
      "An empty tuple is constructed by an empty pair of parentheses such as myempty = (). However, a tuple with a single item is not so simple. You have to specify it using a comma following the first (and only) item so that Python can differentiate between a tuple and a pair of parentheses surrounding the object in an expression i.e. you have to specify singleton = (2 , ) if you mean you want a tuple containing the item 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Note for Perl programmers\n",
      "A list within a list does not lose its identity i.e. lists are not flattened as in Perl. The same applies to a tuple within a tuple, or a tuple within a list, or a list within a tuple, etc. As far as Python is concerned, they are just objects stored using another object, that's all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dictionary\n",
      "A dictionary is like an address-book where you can find the address or contact details of a person by knowing only his/her name i.e. we associate keys (name) with values (details). Note that the key must be unique just like you cannot find out the correct information if you have two persons with the exact same name.\n",
      "Note that you can use only immutable objects (like strings) for the keys of a dictionary but you can use either immutable or mutable objects for the values of the dictionary.  This basically translates to say that you should use only simple objects for keys.\n",
      "Pairs of keys and values are specified in a dictionary by using the notation d = {key1 : value1, key2 : value2 }. Notice that the key-value pairs are separated by a colon and the pairs are separated themselves by commas and all this is enclosed in a pair of curly braces.\n",
      "Remember that key-value pairs in a dictionary are not ordered in any manner. If you want a particular order, then you will have to sort them yourself before using it.\n",
      "The dictionaries that you will be using are instances/objects of the dict class.\n",
      "Example (save as ds_using_dict.py):\n",

      "We can delete key-value pairs using our old friend - the del statement. We simply specify the dictionary and the indexing operator for the key to be removed and pass it to the del statement. There is no need to know the value corresponding to the key for this operation.\n",
      "Next, we access each key-value pair of the dictionary using the items method of the dictionary which returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains a pair of items - the key followed by the value. We retrieve this pair and assign it to the variables name and address correspondingly for each pair using the for..in loop and then print these values in the for-block.\n",
      "We can add new key-value pairs by simply using the indexing operator to access a key and assign that value, as we have done for Guido in the above case.\n",
      "We can check if a key-value pair exists using the in operator.\n",
      "For the list of methods of the dict class, see help(dict).\n",
      "\n",
      "Keyword Arguments and Dictionaries\n",
      "If you have used keyword arguments in your functions, you have already used dictionaries! Just think about it - the key-value pair is specified by you in the parameter list of the function definition and when you access variables within your function, it is just a key access of a dictionary (which is called the symbol table in compiler design terminology).\n",

      "Sequence\n",
      "Lists, tuples and strings are examples of sequences, but what are sequences and what is so special about them?\n",
      "The major features are membership tests, (i.e. the in and not in expressions) and indexing operations, which allow us to fetch a particular item in the sequence directly.\n",
      "The three types of sequences mentioned above - lists, tuples and strings, also have a slicing operation which allows us to retrieve a slice of the sequence i.e. a part of the sequence.\n",

      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "First, we see how to use indexes to get individual items of a sequence. This is also referred to as the subscription operation. Whenever you specify a number to a sequence within square brackets as shown above, Python will fetch you the item corresponding to that position in the sequence. Remember that Python starts counting numbers from 0. Hence, shoplist[0] fetches the first item and shoplist[3] fetches the fourth item in the shoplistsequence.\n",
      "The index can also be a negative number, in which case, the position is calculated from the end of the sequence. Therefore, shoplist[-1] refers to the last item in the sequence and shoplist[-2] fetches the second last item in the sequence.\n",
      "The slicing operation is used by specifying the name of the sequence followed by an optional pair of numbers separated by a colon within square brackets. Note that this is very similar to the indexing operation you have been using till now. Remember the numbers are optional but the colon isn't.\n",
      "The first number (before the colon) in the slicing operation refers to the position from where the slice starts and the second number (after the colon) indicates where the slice will stop at. If the first number is not specified, Python will start at the beginning of the sequence. If the second number is left out, Python will stop at the end of the sequence. Note that the slice returned starts at the start position and will end just before the end position i.e. the start position is included but the end position is excluded from the sequence slice.\n",
      "Thus, shoplist[1:3] returns a slice of the sequence starting at position 1, includes position 2 but stops at position 3 and therefore a slice of two items is returned.  Similarly, shoplist[:] returns a copy of the whole sequence.\n",
      "You can also do slicing with negative positions. Negative numbers are used for positions from the end of the sequence. For example, shoplist[:-1] will return a slice of the sequence which excludes the last item of the sequence but contains everything else.\n",
      "You can also provide a third argument for the slice, which is the step for the slicing (by default, the step size is 1):\n",
      ">>> shoplist = ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']\n",
      ">>> shoplist[::1]\n",
      "['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']\n",
      ">>> shoplist[::2]\n",
      "['apple', 'carrot']\n",
      ">>> shoplist[::3]\n",
      "['apple', 'banana']\n",
      ">>> shoplist[::-1]\n",
      "['banana', 'carrot', 'mango', 'apple']\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that when the step is 2, we get the items with position 0, 2,... When the step size is 3, we get the items with position 0, 3, etc.\n",
      "Try various combinations of such slice specifications using the Python interpreter interactively i.e. the prompt so that you can see the results immediately. The great thing about sequences is that you can access tuples, lists and strings all in the same way!\n",
      "Set\n",
      "Sets are unordered collections of simple objects. These are used when the existence of an object in a collection is more important than the order or how many times it occurs.\n",
      "Using sets, you can test for membership, whether it is a subset of another set, find the intersection between two sets, and so on.\n",
      ">>> bri = set(['brazil', 'russia', 'india'])\n",
      ">>> 'india' in bri\n",
      "True\n",
      ">>> 'usa' in bri\n",

      "How It Works\n",
      "Here, we see a lot of the string methods in action. The startswith method is used to find out whether the string starts with the given string. The in operator is used to check if a given string is a part of the string.\n",
      "The find method is used to locate the position of the given substring within the string; find returns -1 if it is unsuccessful in finding the substring. The str class also has a neat method to join the items of a sequence with the string acting as a delimiter between each item of the sequence and returns a bigger string generated from this.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "We have explored the various built-in data structures of Python in detail. These data structures will be essential for writing programs of reasonable size.\n",
      "Now that we have a lot of the basics of Python in place, we will next see how to design and write a real-world Python program.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem Solving\n",
      "We have explored various parts of the Python language and now we will take a look at how all these parts fit together, by designing and writing a program which does something useful. The idea is to learn how to write a Python script on your own.\n",
      "The Problem\n",
      "The problem we want to solve is:\n",
      "\n",
      "I want a program which creates a backup of all my important files.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although, this is a simple problem, there is not enough information for us to get started with the solution. A little more analysis is required. For example, how do we specify which files are to be backed up? How are they stored? Where are they stored?\n",
      "After analyzing the problem properly, we design our program. We make a list of things about how our program should work. In this case, I have created the following list on how I want it to work. If you do the design, you may not come up with the same kind of analysis since every person has their own way of doing things, so that is perfectly okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The files and directories to be backed up are specified in a list.\n",
      "The backup must be stored in a main backup directory.\n",
      "The files are backed up into a zip file.\n",
      "The name of the zip archive is the current date and time.\n",
      "We use the standard zip command available by default in any standard GNU/Linux or Unix distribution. Note that you can use any archiving command you want as long as it has a command line interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For Windows users\n",
      "Windows users can install the zip command from the GnuWin32 project page and add C:\\Program Files\\GnuWin32\\bin to your system PATH environment variable, similar to what we did for recognizing the python command itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Solution\n",
      "As the design of our program is now reasonably stable, we can write the code which is an implementation of our solution.\n",

      "Now, we are in the testing phase where we test that our program works properly. If it doesn't behave as expected, then we have to debug our program i.e. remove the bugs (errors) from the program.\n",
      "If the above program does not work for you, copy the line printed after the Zip command is line in the output, paste it in the shell (on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X) / cmd (on Windows), see what the error is and try to fix it. Also check the zip command manual on what could be wrong. If this command succeeds, then the problem might be in the Python program itself, so check if it exactly matches the program written above.\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "You will notice how we have converted our design into code in a step-by-step manner.\n",
      "We make use of the os and time modules by first importing them. Then, we specify the files and directories to be backed up in the source list. The target directory is where we store all the backup files and this is specified in the target_dir variable. The name of the zip archive that we are going to create is the current date and time which we generate using the time.strftime() function. It will also have the .zip extension and will be stored in the target_dir directory.\n",
      "Notice the use of the os.sep variable - this gives the directory separator according to your operating system i.e. it will be '/' in GNU/Linux and Unix, it will be '\\\\' in Windows and ':' in Mac OS. Using os.sep instead of these characters directly will make our program portable and work across all of these systems.\n",
      "The time.strftime() function takes a specification such as the one we have used in the above program. The %Y specification will be replaced by the year with the century. The %m specification will be replaced by the month as a decimal number between 01 and 12 and so on. The complete list of such specifications can be found in the Python Reference Manual.\n",
      "We create the name of the target zip file using the addition operator which concatenates the strings i.e. it joins the two strings together and returns a new one. Then, we create a string zip_command which contains the command that we are going to execute. You can check if this command works by running it in the shell (GNU/Linux terminal or DOS prompt).\n",
      "The zip command that we are using has some options and parameters passed. The -r option specifies that the zip command should work recursively for directories i.e. it should include all the subdirectories and files. The two options are combined and specified in a shortcut as -qr. The options are followed by the name of the zip archive to create followed by the list of files and directories to backup. We convert the source list into a string using the join method of strings which we have already seen how to use.\n",
      "Then, we finally run the command using the os.system function which runs the command as if it was run from the system i.e. in the shell - it returns 0 if the command was successfully, else it returns an error number.\n",
      "Depending on the outcome of the command, we print the appropriate message that the backup has failed or succeeded.\n",
      "That's it, we have created a script to take a backup of our important files!\n",
      "\n",
      "Note to Windows Users\n",
      "Instead of double backslash escape sequences, you can also use raw strings. For example, use 'C:\\\\Documents' or r'C:\\Documents'. However, do not use 'C:\\Documents' since you end up using an unknown escape sequence \\D.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have a working backup script, we can use it whenever we want to take a backup of the files. This is called the operation phase or the deployment phase of the software.\n",
      "The above program works properly, but (usually) first programs do not work exactly as you expect. For example, there might be problems if you have not designed the program properly or if you have made a mistake when typing the code, etc. Appropriately, you will have to go back to the design phase or you will have to debug your program.\n",
      "Second Version\n",
      "The first version of our script works. However, we can make some refinements to it so that it can work better on a daily basis. This is called the maintenance phase of the software.\n",
      "One of the refinements I felt was useful is a better file-naming mechanism - using the time as the name of the file within a directory with the current date as a directory within the main backup directory. The first advantage is that your backups are stored in a hierarchical manner and therefore it is much easier to manage. The second advantage is that the filenames are much shorter. The third advantage is that separate directories will help you check if you have made a backup for each day since the directory would be created only if you have made a backup for that day.\n",

      "On careful observation, we see that the single logical line has been split into two physical lines but we have not specified that these two physical lines belong together. Basically, Python has found the addition operator (+) without any operand in that logical line and hence it doesn't know how to continue. Remember that we can specify that the logical line continues in the next physical line by the use of a backslash at the end of the physical line. So, we make this correction to our program.

We take in the user's comments using the input function and then check if the user actually entered something by finding out the length of the input using the len function. If the user has just pressed enter without entering anything (maybe it was just a routine backup or no special changes were made), then we proceed as we have done before.\n",
      "However, if a comment was supplied, then this is attached to the name of the zip archive just before the .zip extension.  Notice that we are replacing spaces in the comment with underscores - this is because managing filenames without spaces is much easier.\n",
      "More Refinements\n",
      "The fourth version is a satisfactorily working script for most users, but there is always room for improvement. For example, you can include a verbosity level for the program where you can specify a -v option to make your program become more talkative or a -q to make it quiet.\n",
      "Another possible enhancement would be to allow extra files and directories to be passed to the script at the command line. We can get these names from the sys.argv list and we can add them to our source list using the extend method provided by the list class.\n",
      "The most important refinement would be to not use the os.system way of creating archives and instead using the zipfile or tarfile built-in modules to create these archives.

      "Summary\n",
      "We have seen how to create our own Python programs/scripts and the various stages involved in writing such programs. You may find it useful to create your own program just like we did in this chapter so that you become comfortable with Python as well as problem-solving.\n",
      "Next, we will discuss object-oriented programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Object Oriented Programming \n",
      "In all the programs we wrote till now, we have designed our program around functions i.e. blocks of statements which manipulate data. This is called the procedure-oriented way of programming. There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object. This is called the object oriented programming paradigm. Most of the time you can use procedural programming, but when writing large programs or have a problem that is better suited to this method, you can use object oriented programming techniques.\n",
      "Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. An analogy is that you can have variables of type int which translates to saying that variables that store integers are variables which are instances (objects) of the int class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note for Static Language Programmers\n",
      "Note that even integers are treated as objects (of the int class). This is unlike C++ and Java (before version 1.5) where integers are primitive native types.\n",
      "See help(int) for more details on the class.\n",
      "C# and Java 1.5 programmers will find this similar to the boxing and unboxing concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Objects can store data using ordinary variables that belong to the object. Variables that belong to an object or class are referred to as fields. Objects can also have functionality by using functions that belong to a class. Such functions are called methods of the class. This terminology is important because it helps us to differentiate between functions and variables which are independent and those which belong to a class or object. Collectively, the fields and methods can be referred to as the attributes of that class.\n",
      "Fields are of two types - they can belong to each instance/object of the class or they can belong to the class itself. They are called instance variables and class variables respectively.\n",
      "A class is created using the class keyword. The fields and methods of the class are listed in an indented block.\n",
      "The self \n",
      "Class methods have only one specific difference from ordinary functions - they must have an extra first name that has to be added to the beginning of the parameter list, but you do not give a value for this parameter when you call the method, Python will provide it. This particular variable refers to the object itself, and by convention, it is given the name self.\n",
      "Although, you can give any name for this parameter, it is strongly recommended that you use the name self - any other name is definitely frowned upon. There are many advantages to using a standard name - any reader of your program will immediately recognize it and even specialized IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) can help you if you use self.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note for C++/Java/C# Programmers\n",
      "The self in Python is equivalent to the this pointer in C++ and the this reference in Java and C#.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must be wondering how Python gives the value for self and why you don't need to give a value for it. An example will make this clear. Say you have a class called MyClass and an instance of this class called myobject. When you call a method of this object as myobject.method(arg1, arg2), this is automatically converted by Python into MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2) - this is all the special self is about.\n",
      "This also means that if you have a method which takes no arguments, then you still have to have one argument - the self.\n",
      "Classes \n",
      "The simplest class possible is shown in the following example (save as oop_simplestclass.py).\n",
      "class Person:\n",
      "    pass  # An empty block\n",
      "\n",
      "p = Person()\n",
      "print(p)\n",
      "\n",
      "Output:\n",
      "$ python oop_simplestclass.py\n",
      "<__main__.Person instance at 0x10171f518>\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "We create a new class using the class statement and the name of the class. This is followed by an indented block of statements which form the body of the class. In this case, we have an empty block which is indicated using the pass statement.\n",
      "Next, we create an object/instance of this class using the name of the class followed by a pair of parentheses. (We will learn more about instantiation in the next section). For our verification, we confirm the type of the variable by simply printing it. It tells us that we have an instance of the Person class in the __main__ module.\n",
      "Notice that the address of the computer memory where your object is stored is also printed. The address will have a different value on your computer since Python can store the object wherever it finds space.\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "We have already discussed that classes/objects can have methods just like functions except that we have an extra self variable. We will now see an example (save as oop_method.py).\n",
      "class Person:\n",
      "    def say_hi(self):\n",
      "        print('Hello, how are you?')\n",
      "\n",
      "p = Person()\n",
      "p.say_hi()\n",
      "# The previous 2 lines can also be written as\n",
      "# Person().say_hi()\n",
      "\n",
      "Output:\n",
      "$ python oop_method.py\n",
      "Hello, how are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "Here we see the self in action. Notice that the say_hi method takes no parameters but still has the self in the function definition.\n",
      "The __init__ method \n",
      "There are many method names which have special significance in Python classes. We will see the significance of the __init__ method now.\n",
      "The __init__ method is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object. Notice the double underscores both at the beginning and at the end of the name.\n",
      "Example (save as oop_init.py):\n",
      "class Person:\n",
      "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
      "        self.name = name\n",
      "\n",
      "    def say_hi(self):\n",
      "        print('Hello, my name is', self.name)\n",
      "\n",
      "p = Person('Swaroop')\n",
      "p.say_hi()\n",
      "# The previous 2 lines can also be written as\n",
      "# Person('Swaroop').say_hi()\n",
      "\n",
      "Output:\n",
      "$ python oop_init.py\n",
      "Hello, my name is Swaroop\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "Here, we define the __init__ method as taking a parameter name (along with the usual self). Here, we just create a new field also called name. Notice these are two different variables even though they are both called 'name'. There is no problem because the dotted notation self.name means that there is something called \"name\" that is part of the object called \"self\" and the other name is a local variable. Since we explicitly indicate which name we are referring to, there is no confusion.\n",
      "When creating new instance p, of the class Person, we do so by using the class name, followed by the arguments in the parentheses: p = Person('Swaroop').\n",
      "We do not explicitly call the __init__ method.\n",
      "This is the special significance of this method.\n",
      "Now, we are able to use the self.name field in our methods which is demonstrated in the say_hi method.\n",
      "Class And Object Variables \n",
      "We have already discussed the functionality part of classes and objects (i.e. methods), now let us learn about the data part. The data part, i.e. fields, are nothing but ordinary variables that are bound to the namespaces of the classes and objects. This means that these names are valid within the context of these classes and objects only. That's why they are called name spaces.\n",
      "There are two types of fields - class variables and object variables which are classified depending on whether the class or the object owns the variables respectively.\n",
      "Class variables are shared - they can be accessed by all instances of that class. There is only one copy of the class variable and when any one object makes a change to a class variable, that change will be seen by all the other instances.\n",
      "Object variables are owned by each individual object/instance of the class. In this case, each object has its own copy of the field i.e. they are not shared and are not related in any way to the field by the same name in a different instance. An example will make this easy to understand (save as oop_objvar.py):\n",

      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "This is a long example but helps demonstrate the nature of class and object variables. Here, population belongs to the Robot class and hence is a class variable. The name variable belongs to the object (it is assigned using self) and hence is an object variable.\n",
      "Thus, we refer to the population class variable as Robot.population and not as self.population. We refer to the object variable name using self.name notation in the methods of that object. Remember this simple difference between class and object variables. Also note that an object variable with the same name as a class variable will hide the class variable!\n",
      "Instead of Robot.population, we could have also used self.__class__.population because every object refers to its class via the self.__class__ attribute.\n",
      "The how_many is actually a method that belongs to the class and not to the object. This means we can define it as either a classmethod or a staticmethod depending on whether we need to know which class we are part of. Since we refer to a class variable, let's use classmethod.\n",
      "We have marked the how_many method as a class method using a decorator.\n",
      "Decorators can be imagined to be a shortcut to calling a wrapper function, so applying the @classmethod decorator is same as calling:\n",
      "how_many = classmethod(how_many)\n",
      "\n",
      "Observe that the __init__ method is used to initialize the Robot instance with a name. In this method, we increase the population count by 1 since we have one more robot being added. Also observe that the values of self.name is specific to each object which indicates the nature of object variables.\n",
      "Remember, that you must refer to the variables and methods of the same object using the self only. This is called an attribute reference.\n",
      "In this program, we also see the use of docstrings for classes as well as methods. We can access the class docstring at runtime using Robot.__doc__ and the method docstring as Robot.say_hi.__doc__\n",
      "In the die method, we simply decrease the Robot.population count by 1.\n",
      "All class members are public. One exception: If you use data members with names using the double underscore prefix such as __privatevar, Python uses name-mangling to effectively make it a private variable.\n",
      "Thus, the convention followed is that any variable that is to be used only within the class or object should begin with an underscore and all other names are public and can be used by other classes/objects. Remember that this is only a convention and is not enforced by Python (except for the double underscore prefix).\n",
      "\n",
      "Note for C++/Java/C# Programmers\n",
      "All class members (including the data members) are public and all the methods are virtual in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inheritance\n",
      "One of the major benefits of object oriented programming is reuse of code and one of the ways this is achieved is through the inheritance mechanism. Inheritance can be best imagined as implementing a type and subtype relationship between classes.\n",
      "Suppose you want to write a program which has to keep track of the teachers and students in a college. They have some common characteristics such as name, age and address. They also have specific characteristics such as salary, courses and leaves for teachers and, marks and fees for students.\n",
      "You can create two independent classes for each type and process them but adding a new common characteristic would mean adding to both of these independent classes. This quickly becomes unwieldy.\n",
      "A better way would be to create a common class called SchoolMember and then have the teacher and student classes inherit from this class i.e. they will become sub-types of this type (class) and then we can add specific characteristics to these sub-types.\n",
      "There are many advantages to this approach. If we add/change any functionality in SchoolMember, this is automatically reflected in the subtypes as well. For example, you can add a new ID card field for both teachers and students by simply adding it to the SchoolMember class. However, changes in the subtypes do not affect other subtypes. Another advantage is that if you can refer to a teacher or student object as a SchoolMember object which could be useful in some situations such as counting of the number of school members. This is called polymorphism where a sub-type can be substituted in any situation where a parent type is expected i.e. the object can be treated as an instance of the parent class.\n",
      "Also observe that we reuse the code of the parent class and we do not need to repeat it in the different classes as we would have had to in case we had used independent classes.\n",
      "The SchoolMember class in this situation is known as the base class or the superclass. The Teacher and Student classes are called the derived classes or subclasses.\n",
      "We will now see this example as a program (save as oop_subclass.py):\n",
      "class SchoolMember:\n",
      "    '''Represents any school member.'''\n",

      "How It Works\n",
      "To use inheritance, we specify the base class names in a tuple following the class name in the class definition. Next, we observe that the __init__ method of the base class is explicitly called using the self variable so that we can initialize the base class part of the object. This is very important to remember - Since we are defining a __init__ method in Teacher and Student subclasses, Python does not automatically call the constructor of the base class SchoolMember, you have to explicitly call it yourself.\n",
      "In contrast, if we have not defined an __init__ method in a subclass, Python will call the constructor of the base class automatically.\n",
      "We also observe that we can call methods of the base class by prefixing the class name to the method call and then pass in the self variable along with any arguments.\n",
      "Notice that we can treat instances of Teacher or Student as just instances of the SchoolMember when we use the tell method of the SchoolMember class.\n",
      "Also, observe that the tell method of the subtype is called and not the tell method of the SchoolMember class. One way to understand this is that Python always starts looking for methods in the actual type, which in this case it does. If it could not find the method, it starts looking at the methods belonging to its base classes one by one in the order they are specified in the tuple in the class definition.\n",
      "A note on terminology - if more than one class is listed in the inheritance tuple, then it is called multiple inheritance.\n",
      "The end parameter is used in the print function in the superclass's tell() method to print a line and allow the next print to continue on the same line. This is a trick to make print not print a \\n (newline) symbol at the end of the printing.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "We have now explored the various aspects of classes and objects as well as the various terminologies associated with it. We have also seen the benefits and pitfalls of object-oriented programming. Python is highly object-oriented and understanding these concepts carefully will help you a lot in the long run.\n",

      "For output, we can also use the various methods of the str (string) class. For example, you can use the rjust method to get a string which is right justified to a specified width. See help(str) for more details.\n",

We can also provide a third argument that determines the step by which the slicing is done. The default step is 1 because of which it returns a continuous part of the text. Giving a negative step, i.e., -1 will return the text in reverse.\n",
      "The input() function takes a string as argument and displays it to the user. Then it waits for the user to type something and press the return key. Once the user has entered and pressed the return key, the input() function will then return that text the user has entered.\n",
      "We take that text and reverse it. If the original text and reversed text are equal, then the text is a palindrome.\n",
      "Homework exercise\n",
      "Checking whether a text is a palindrome should also ignore punctuation, spaces and case. For example, \"Rise to vote, sir.\" is also a palindrome but our current program doesn't say it is. Can you improve the above program to recognize this palindrome?\n",

      "Files\n",
      "You can open and use files for reading or writing by creating an object of the file class and using its read, readline or write methods appropriately to read from or write to the file. The ability to read or write to the file depends on the mode you have specified for the file opening. Then finally, when you are finished with the file, you call the close method to tell Python that we are done using the file.\n",

      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "First, open a file by using the built-in open function and specifying the name of the file and the mode in which we want to open the file. The mode can be a read mode ('r'), write mode ('w') or append mode ('a'). We can also specify whether we are reading, writing, or appending in text mode ('t') or binary mode ('b'). There are actually many more modes available and help(open) will give you more details about them. By default, open() considers the file to be a 't'ext file and opens it in 'r'ead mode.\n",
      "In our example, we first open the file in write text mode and use the write method of the file object to write to the file and then we finally close the file.\n",
      "Next, we open the same file again for reading. We don't need to specify a mode because 'read text file' is the default mode. We read in each line of the file using the readline method in a loop. This method returns a complete line including the newline character at the end of the line. When an empty string is returned, it means that we have reached the end of the file and we 'break' out of the loop.\n",
      "In the end, we finally close the file.\n",
      "Now, check the contents of the poem.txt file to confirm that the program has indeed written to and read from that file.\n",
      "Pickle\n",
      "Python provides a standard module called pickle using which you can store any plain Python object in a file and then get it back later. This is called storing the object persistently.\n",

      "# Write to the file\n",
      "f = open(shoplistfile, 'wb')\n",
      "# Dump the object to a file\n",
      "pickle.dump(shoplist, f)\n",
      "f.close()\n",
      "\n",
      "# Destroy the shoplist variable\n",

      "Next, we retrieve the object using the load function of the pickle module which returns the object. This process is called unpickling.\n",
      "Unicode\n",
      "So far, when we have been writing and using strings, or reading and writing to a file, we have used simple English characters only.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE: If you are using Python 2, and we want to be able to read and write other non-English languages, we need to use the unicode type, and it all starts with the character u, e.g. u\"hello world\"\n",

      "\n",
      "When we read or write to a file or when we talk to other computers on the Internet, we need to convert our unicode strings into a format that can be sent and received, and that format is called \"UTF-8\". We can read and write in that format, using a simple keyword argument to our standard open function:\n",

      "You can ignore the import statement for now, we'll explore that in detail in the modules chapter.\n",
      "Whenever we write a program that uses Unicode literals like we have used above, we have to make sure that Python itself is told that our program uses UTF-8, and we have to put # encoding=utf-8 comment at the top of our program.\n",

      "Exceptions\n",
      "Exceptions occur when exceptional situations occur in your program. For example, what if you are going to read a file and the file does not exist? Or what if you accidentally deleted it when the program was running? Such situations are handled using exceptions.\n",
      "Similarly, what if your program had some invalid statements? This is handled by Python which raises its hands and tells you there is an error.\n",
      "Errors\n",
      "Consider a simple print function call. What if we misspelt print as Print? Note the capitalization. In this case, Python raises a syntax error.\n",

      "\n",
      "Python raises an error called EOFError which basically means it found an end of file symbol (which is represented by ctrl-d) when it did not expect to see it.\n",
      "Handling Exceptions\n",
      "We can handle exceptions using the try..except statement.  We basically put our usual statements within the try-block and put all our error handlers in the except-block.\n",
      "Example (save as exceptions_handle.py):\n",

      "Enter something --> No exceptions\n",
      "You entered No exceptions\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "We put all the statements that might raise exceptions/errors inside the try block and then put handlers for the appropriate errors/exceptions in the except clause/block. The except clause can handle a single specified error or exception, or a parenthesized list of errors/exceptions. If no names of errors or exceptions are supplied, it will handle all errors and exceptions.\n",
      "Note that there has to be at least one except clause associated with every try clause. Otherwise, what's the point of having a try block?\n",
      "If any error or exception is not handled, then the default Python handler is called which just stops the execution of the program and prints an error message. We have already seen this in action above.\n",
      "You can also have an else clause associated with a try..except block. The else clause is executed if no exception occurs.\n",
      "In the next example, we will also see how to get the exception object so that we can retrieve additional information.\n",
      "Raising Exceptions\n",
      "You can raise exceptions using the raise statement by providing the name of the error/exception and the exception object that is to be thrown.\n",
      "The error or exception that you can raise should be a class which directly or indirectly must be a derived class of the Exception class.\n",

      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "Here, we are creating our own exception type. This new exception type is called ShortInputException. It has two fields - length which is the length of the given input, and atleast which is the minimum length that the program was expecting.\n",
      "In the except clause, we mention the class of error which will be stored as the variable name to hold the corresponding error/exception object. This is analogous to parameters and arguments in a function call.

      "We do the usual file-reading stuff, but we have arbitrarily introduced sleeping for 2 seconds after printing each line using the time.sleep function so that the program runs slowly (Python is very fast by nature). When the program is still running, press ctrl + c to interrupt/cancel the program.\n",
      "Observe that the KeyboardInterrupt exception is thrown and the program quits. However, before the program exits, the finally clause is executed and the file object is always closed.\n",
      "Note that we use sys.stdout.flush() after print so that it prints to the screen immediately.\n",
      "The with statement \n",
      "Acquiring a resource in the try block and subsequently releasing the resource in the finally block is a common pattern. Hence, there is also a with statement that enables this to be done in a clean manner:\n",

      "    for line in f:\n",

      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "The output should be same as the previous example. The difference here is that we are using the open function with the with statement - we leave the closing of the file to be done automatically by with open.\n",
      "What happens behind the scenes is that there is a protocol used by the with statement. It fetches the object returned by the open statement, let's call it \"thefile\" in this case.\n",
      "It always calls the thefile.__enter__ function before starting the block of code under it and always calls thefile.__exit__ after finishing the block of code.\n",
      "So the code that we would have written in a finally block should be taken care of automatically by the __exit__ method. This is what helps us to avoid having to use explicit try..finally statements repeatedly.\n",

      "First, we check which operating system we are using by checking the string returned by platform.platform() (for more information, see import platform; help(platform)). If it is Windows, we figure out the home drive, the home folder and the filename where we want to store the information. Putting these three parts together, we get the full location of the file. For other platforms, we need to know just the home folder of the user and we get the full location of the file.\n",
      "We use the os.path.join() function to put these three parts of the location together. The reason to use a special function rather than just adding the strings together is because this function will ensure the full location matches the format expected by the operating system.\n",
      "We configure the logging module to write all the messages in a particular format to the file we have specified.\n",
      "Finally, we can put messages that are either meant for debugging, information, warning or even critical messages. Once the program has run, we can check this file and we will know what happened in the program, even though no information was displayed to the user running the program.\n",

      "So far we have covered a majority of the various aspects of Python that you will use. In this chapter, we will cover some more aspects that will make our knowledge of Python more well-rounded.\n",
      "Passing tuples around\n",
      "Ever wished you could return two different values from a function? You can. All you have to do is use a tuple.\n",
      ">>> def get_error_details():\n",
      "...     return (2, 'details')\n",
      "...\n",
      ">>> errnum, errstr = get_error_details()\n",

      "2\n",
      ">>> errstr\n",
      "'details'\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that the usage of a, b = <some expression> interprets the result of the expression as a tuple with two values.\n",
      "This also means the fastest way to swap two variables in Python is:\n",
      ">>> a = 5; b = 8\n",
      ">>> a, b\n",
      "(5, 8)\n",
      ">>> a, b = b, a\n",

      "\n",
      "Special Methods\n",
      "There are certain methods such as the __init__ and __del__ methods which have special significance in classes.\n",
      "Special methods are used to mimic certain behaviors of built-in types. For example, if you want to use the x[key] indexing operation for your class (just like you use it for lists and tuples), then all you have to do is implement the __getitem__() method and your job is done. If you think about it, this is what Python does for the list class itself!\n",
      "Some useful special methods are listed in the following table. If you want to know about all the special methods, see the manual.\n",
      "\n",
      "__init__(self, ...)\n",
      "\n",
      "This method is called just before the newly created object is returned for usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "__del__(self)\n",
      "\n",
      "Called just before the object is destroyed (which has unpredictable timing, so avoid using this)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "__str__(self)\n",
      "\n",
      "Called when we use the print function or when str() is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "__lt__(self, other)\n",
      "\n",
      "Called when the less than operator (<) is used. Similarly, there are special methods for all the operators (+, >, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "__getitem__(self, key)\n",
      "\n",
      "Called when x[key] indexing operation is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "__len__(self)\n",
      "\n",
      "Called when the built-in len() function is used for the sequence object.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Single Statement Blocks\n",
      "We have seen that each block of statements is set apart from the rest by its own indentation level. Well, there is one caveat. If your block of statements contains only one single statement, then you can specify it on the same line of, say, a conditional statement or looping statement. The following example should make this clear:\n",
      ">>> flag = True\n",
      ">>> if flag: print('Yes')\n",
      "...\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that the single statement is used in-place and not as a separate block.  Although, you can use this for making your program smaller, I strongly recommend avoiding this short-cut method, except for error checking, mainly because it will be much easier to add an extra statement if you are using proper indentation.\n",
      "Lambda Forms\n",
      "A lambda statement is used to create new function objects. Essentially, the lambda takes a parameter followed by a single expression. Lambda becomes the body of the function. The value of this expression is returned by the new function.\n",
      "Example (save as more_lambda.py):\n",
      "points = [{'x': 2, 'y': 3},\n",
      "          {'x': 4, 'y': 1}]\n",
      "points.sort(key=lambda i: i['y'])\n",
      "print(points)\n",
      "\n",
      "Output:\n",
      "$ python more_lambda.py\n",
      "[{'y': 1, 'x': 4}, {'y': 3, 'x': 2}]\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "Notice that the sort method of a list can take a key parameter which determines how the list is sorted (usually we know only about ascending or descending order). In our case, we want to do a custom sort, and for that we need to write a function. Instead of writing a separate def block for a function that will get used in only this one place, we use a lambda expression to create a new function.\n",
      "List Comprehension\n",
      "List comprehensions are used to derive a new list from an existing list. Suppose you have a list of numbers and you want to get a corresponding list with all the numbers multiplied by 2 only when the number itself is greater than 2. List comprehensions are ideal for such situations.\n",
      "Example (save as more_list_comprehension.py):\n",
      "listone = [2, 3, 4]\n",
      "listtwo = [2*i for i in listone if i > 2]\n",
      "print(listtwo)\n",
      "\n",
      "Output:\n",
      "$ python more_list_comprehension.py\n",
      "[6, 8]\n",
      "\n",
      "How It Works\n",
      "Here, we derive a new list by specifying the manipulation to be done (2*i) when some condition is satisfied (if i > 2). Note that the original list remains unmodified.\n",
      "The advantage of using list comprehensions is that it reduces the amount of boilerplate code required when we use loops to process each element of a list and store it in a new list.\n",
      "Receiving Tuples and Dictionaries in Functions\n",
      "There is a special way of receiving parameters to a function as a tuple or a dictionary using the * or ** prefix respectively. This is useful when taking variable number of arguments in the function.\n",
      ">>> def powersum(power, *args):\n",
      "...     '''Return the sum of each argument raised to the specified power.'''\n",
      "...     total = 0\n",
      "...     for i in args:\n",
      "...         total += pow(i, power)\n",
      "...     return total\n",
      "...\n",
      ">>> powersum(2, 3, 4)\n",
      "25\n",
      ">>> powersum(2, 10)\n",
      "100\n",
      "\n",
      "Because we have a * prefix on the args variable, all extra arguments passed to the function are stored in args as a tuple.  If a ** prefix had been used instead, the extra parameters would be considered to be key/value pairs of a dictionary.\n",
      "The assert statement \n",
      "The assert statement is used to assert that something is true. For example, if you are very sure that you will have at least one element in a list you are using and want to check this, and raise an error if it is not true, then assert statement is ideal in this situation. When the assert statement fails, an AssertionError is raised.\n",
      "The pop() method removes and returns the last item from the list.\n",
      ">>> mylist = ['item']\n",
      ">>> assert len(mylist) >= 1\n",
      ">>> mylist.pop()\n",
      "'item'\n",
      ">>> assert len(mylist) >= 1\n",
      "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
      "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
      "AssertionError\n",
      "\n",
      "The assert statement should be used judiciously. Most of the time, it is better to catch exceptions, either handle the problem or display an error message to the user and then quit.\n",
      "Decorators \n",
      "Decorators are a shortcut to applying wrapper functions. This is helpful to \"wrap\" functionality with the same code over and over again. For example, I created a retry decorator for myself that I can just apply to any function and if any exception is thrown during a run, it is retried again, till a maximum of 5 times and with a delay between each retry. This is especially useful for situations where you are trying to make a network call to a remote computer:\n",

      "In the sixth draft, I decided to use Quanta+ to do all the editing. The standard XSL stylesheets that came with Fedora Core 3 Linux were being used. However, I had written a CSS document to give color and style to the HTML pages. I had also written a crude lexical analyzer, in Python of course, which automatically provides syntax highlighting to all the program listings.\n",
      "For the seventh draft, I was using MediaWiki as the basis of my setup. I used to edit everything online and the readers can directly read/edit/discuss within the wiki website, but I ended up spending more time fighting spam than writing.\n",

      "I first started with Python when I needed to write an installer for software I had written called 'Diamond' so that I could make the installation easy. I had to choose between Python and Perl bindings for the Qt library. I did some research on the web and I came across an article by Eric S. Raymond, a famous and respected hacker, where he talked about how Python had become his favorite programming language. I also found out that the PyQt bindings were more mature compared to Perl-Qt. So, I decided that Python was the language for me.\n",
      "Then, I started searching for a good book on Python. I couldn't find any!  I did find some O'Reilly books but they were either too expensive or were more like a reference manual than a guide. So, I settled for the documentation that came with Python. However, it was too brief and small. It did give a good idea about Python but was not complete. I managed with it since I had previous programming experience, but it was unsuitable for newbies.\n",
      "About six months after my first brush with Python, I installed the (then) latest Red Hat 9.0 Linux and I was playing around with KWord. I got excited about it and suddenly got the idea of writing some stuff on Python. I started writing a few pages but it quickly became 30 pages long. Then, I became serious about making it more useful in a book form. After a lot of rewrites, it has reached a stage where it has become a useful guide to learning the Python language.  I consider this book to be my contribution and tribute to the open source community.\n",
      "This book started out as my personal notes on Python and I still consider it in the same way, although I've taken a lot of effort to make it more palatable to others :)\n",

      "I'm 32 years old and have a degree of Mathematics from University of Heidelberg, Germany. Currently I'm working as a software engineer on a publicly funded project to build a web portal for all things related to computer science in Germany.The main language I use as a professional is Java, but I try to do as much as possible with Python behind the scenes. Especially text analysis and conversion is very easy with Python. I'm not very familiar with GUI toolkits, since most of my programming is about web applications, where the user interface is build using Java frameworks like Struts. Currently I try to make more use of the functional programming features of Python and of generators.  After taking a short look into Ruby, I was very impressed with the use of blocks in this language. Generally I like the dynamic nature of languages like Python and Ruby since it allows me to do things not possible in more static languages like Java.I've searched for some kind of introduction to programming, suitable to teach a complete non-programmer. I've found the book 'How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python', and 'Dive into Python'. The first is good for beginners but to long to translate. The second is not suitable for beginners. I think 'A Byte of Python' falls nicely between these, since it is not too long, written to the point, and at the same time verbose enough to teach a newbie. Besides this, I like the simple DocBook structure, which makes translating the text a generation the output in various formats a charm.\n",

After studying computer science I started working as a software engineer. Currently I am working in the field of medical imaging for a major german company. Although C++ is the main language I (have to) use for my daily work, I am constantly looking for new things to learn.Last year I fell in love with Python, which is a wonderful language, both for its possibilities and its beauty. I read somewhere in the net about a guy who said that he likes python, because the code looks so beautiful. In my opinion he's absolutly right. At the time I decided to learn python, I noticed that there is very little good documentation in german available. When I came across your book the spontaneous idea of a german translation crossed my mind.

Here are students from different departments: linguistics, chemistry, biology, etc. We try to find interesting publications on the Internet that can be relevant for us and our university colleagues. Sometimes we find articles by ourselves; other times our professors help us choose the material for translation. After obtaining permission from authors we translate articles and post them in our blog which is available and accessible to our colleagues and friends. These translated publications often help students in their daily study routine.\n",
