      "Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University,[8] is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco. Its 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2)[9] campus is one of the largest in the United States.[note 1] Stanford also has land and facilities elsewhere.[7][9]\n",
      "The university was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year. Stanford was a former Governor of California and U.S. Senator; he made his fortune as a railroad tycoon. The school admitted its first students 125 years ago on October 1, 1891,[2][3] as a coeducational and non-denominational institution.\n",
      "Stanford University struggled financially after Leland Stanford's death in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[12] Following World War II, Provost Frederick Terman supported faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would later be known as Silicon Valley.[13] The rise of Silicon Valley helped Stanford become one of the world's most prestigious universities.[note 2] The university is also one of the top fundraising institutions in the country, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.[23]\n",
      "There are three academic schools that have both undergraduate and graduate students and another four professional schools. Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference. It has gained 111 NCAA team championships,[24] the second-most for a university, 483 individual championships, the most in Division I,[25] and has won the NACDA Directors' Cup, recognizing the university with the best overall athletic team achievement, for 22 consecutive years, beginning in 1994–1995.[26]\n",

      "Stanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford, dedicated to Leland Stanford Jr, their only child. The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Despite being impacted by earthquakes in both 1906 and 1989, the campus was rebuilt each time. In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by Herbert Hoover to preserve artifacts related to World War I. The Stanford Medical Center, completed in 1959, is a teaching hospital with over 800 beds. The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (originally named the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), which was established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.[51]\n",

      "Many Stanford faculty members live in the \"Faculty Ghetto\", within walking or biking distance of campus.[62] The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned entirely by Stanford. Similar to a condominium, the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the \"Ghetto\" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall Silicon Valley values. However, it remains an expensive area in which to own property, and the average price of single-family homes on campus is actually higher than in Palo Alto.[citation needed]\n",
      "Some of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park. Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the Palo Alto Unified School District for several schools including Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School.[63] El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park (established 1914), is also on Stanford land.[64]\n",

It concluded on December 31, 2011, having raised a total of $6.23 billion and breaking the previous campaign fundraising record of $3.88 billion held by Yale.[89][90] Specifically, the campaign raised $253.7 million for undergraduate financial aid, as well as $2.33 billion for its initiative in \"Seeking Solutions\" to global problems, $1.61 billion for \"Educating Leaders\" by improving K-12 education, and $2.11 billion for \"Foundation of Excellence\" aimed at providing academic support for Stanford students and faculty. Funds supported 366 new fellowships for graduate students, 139 new endowed chairs for faculty, and 38 new or renovated buildings. The new funding also enabled the construction of a facility for stem cell research; a new campus for the business school; an expansion of the law school; a new Engineering Quad; a new art and art history building; an on-campus concert hall; a new art museum; and a planned expansion of the medical school, among other things.[91][92]\n",

      "As of 2010, fifteen percent of undergraduates were first-generation students.[155]\n",
      "As of 2013, 89% of undergraduate students lived in on-campus university housing. First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus, and all undergraduates are guaranteed housing for all four undergraduate years.[95][156] Undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, row houses, and fraternities and sororities.[157] At Manzanita Park, 118 mobile homes were installed as \"temporary\" housing from 1969 to 1991, but as of 2015 was the site of newer dorms Castano, Kimball, Lantana, and the Humanities House, completed in 2015.[158][159] Most student residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are reserved for freshman, sophomores, or upperclass students and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male fraternities, three are all-female sororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors), including all Wilbur dorms except for Arroyo and Okada.[160]\n",

Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Academic Focus), Branner Hall (Community Service), Kimball (Arts & Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority).[157] Theme houses predating the current \"theme\" classification system are Columbae (Social Change Through Nonviolence, since 1970),[161] and Synergy (Exploring Alternatives, since 1972).[162]\n",
      "Co-ops or \"Self-Ops\" are another housing option. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial LGBT house),[163] and Synergy.[164] Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op.[165]\n",
      "As of 2015 around 55 percent of the graduate student population lived on campus.[166] First-year graduate students are guaranteed on-campus housing. Stanford also subsidizes off-campus apartments in nearby Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Mountain View for graduate students who are guaranteed on-campus housing but are unable to live on campus due to a lack of space.[167]\n",
      "As of 2016 Stanford had 16 male varsity sports and 20 female varsity sports,[168] 19 club sports[169] and about 27 intramural sports[170] In 1930, following a unanimous vote by the Executive Committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department adopted the mascot \"Indian.\" The Indian symbol and name were later dropped by President Richard Lyman in 1972, after objections from Native American students and a vote by the student senate.[171] The sports teams are now officially referred to as the \"Stanford Cardinal\", referring to the deep red color, not the cardinal bird. Stanford is a member of the Pac-12 Conference in most sports, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in several other sports, and the America East Conference in field hockey[172] with the participation in the inter-collegiate NCAA's Division I FBS.\n",

      "The Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of their course and work schedules; the center displays the \"Windhover\" paintings by Nathan Olivera, the late Stanford professor and artist.[196]\n",
      "Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to the student groups; these include the Catholic Community at Stanford[197] and Hillel at Stanford.[198]\n",
      "Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891, when the university first opened. In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.[199] However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.[200] Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until Spring quarter of their freshman year.[201]\n",
      "As of 2016 Stanford had 31 Greek organizations, including 14 sororities and 16 fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations are housed (eight in University owned houses and one, Sigma Chi, in their own house [though the land is the University][202]). Six chapters were members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, 11 chapters were members of the Interfraternity Council, 7 chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and 6 chapters belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.[203]\n",
      "As of 2014 Stanford had 650 student organizations.[205] Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the University via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU.

Close to 70 percent of students who reported an experience of sexual misconduct involving nonconsensual penetration and/or oral sex indicated the same.\"[225] Associated Students of Stanford University and student and alumni activists with the anti-rape group Stand with Leah criticized the survey methodology for downgrading incidents involving alcohol if students did not check two separate boxes indicating they were both intoxicated and incapacity while sexually assaulted.[225] Reporting on the Brock Turner rape case, a reporter from The Washington Post analyzed campus rape reports submitted by universities to the U.S. Department of Education, and found that Stanford was one of the top ten universities in campus rapes in 2014, with 26 reported that year, but when analyzed by rapes per 1000 students, Stanford was not among the top ten.[226]\n",
      "Early in the morning of January 18, 2015, a woman visiting campus to attend a party at the Kappa Alpha fraternity was raped by Brock Turner, a freshman who had a swimming scholarship. The rape was interrupted by two Swedish graduate students.[227] Stanford immediately referred the case to prosecutors and offered the woman counseling, and within two weeks had barred Turner from campus after conducting an investigation.[228] Turner was convicted on three felony charges in March 2016 and in June 2016 he received a jail sentence of six months and was declared a sex offender, requiring him to register as such for the rest of his life; prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence out of the maximum 14 years that was possible.[229] The case and the relatively lenient sentence drew nationwide attention.[230] The judge in the case, a Stanford graduate, faced a recall effort in the aftermath.[227]\n",
