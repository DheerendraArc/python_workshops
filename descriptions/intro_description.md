# Intro to Python for Humanities and Social Sciences

The objective of this workshop is to introduce students to the Python programming language and several libraries particularly useful for the humanities and social sciences. In learning basic Python syntax, we'll also learn to scrape information from the web and parse it for varied uses.

Preparation: Please install [Anaconda with Python 3.5](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). If you need help with the installation, please arrive 20 minutes early and we're happy to help you.
