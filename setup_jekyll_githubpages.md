# Setup for Jekyll and Github Pages

## Requirements
- Github account
- Github Desktop or facility with using git in a shell
- Ruby, with Jekyll and Bundler gems installed
- A Bash shell. This is included in MacOS and Linux, and in the newest 64bit Windows. For older versions of Windows, you can download [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) to get Git Bash.
- A text editor (Atom is a great choice: [Atom](https://atom.io/))

## Create a Github account

From the [Github home page](https://github.com/), sign up for a Github account. You only need a free account. For this workshop, your website will end up with a url like, www.username.github.io/projectname, so pick your username wisely. You can also add custom domains for your URL, but we won't be covering that in this workshop.  

## Download Github Desktop

[https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)

After you've downloaded this, open up the application and sign-in with your Github account.

## Download a Bash shell if necessary

If you are on a Mac or Linux machine, you should already have a Bash shell available.

If you have a Windows machine with 64bit Windows 10, you might have a Bash shell available. You can turn it on with these [instructions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide).

For any Windows user, you can also download Git for Windows, which will include Git Bash, a Bash shell for Windows. Go [here](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).

## Download Ruby and the Bundler and Jekyll gems

There are a number of great tutorials on Jekyll out there, some of which nicely go through the setup on Windows machines, which is, unfortunately, more complicated. Rather than recreate already solid instructions, we'll use the instructions for installing Jekyll and everything necessary for it from the Programming Historian: [here](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#section2). Please read and do all the instructions in "Installing dependencies." There are specific instructions for Mac/Linux and Windows.

## Download a text editor

There a lot of text editors out there, and your OS might have one already installed. I like to recommend Atom, though, which is made by Github and has a lot of great options out of the box. See [Atom](https://atom.io/). Note that a text editor in this context is a plain text editor, which means that Microsoft Word or Apple Pages will *not* work.
