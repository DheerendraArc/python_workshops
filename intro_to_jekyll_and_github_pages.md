## Goals

By the end of this workshop, we hope that through building a sample website and deploying it to Github Pages, you will understand why you would use Jekyll vs a content management system like Wordpress, how websites are built with Jekyll, and how to deploy a Jekyll website to Github for free hosting. 

## Quick Quiz
- Some sort of multiple choice question through a webform that will let me get instant feedback on level of familiarity with code (especially HTML/CSS)

## Setup

### You need:
- a Github account
- Github Desktop or experience with git in your shell
- Ruby
- A Bash shell (this is included in MacOS and Linux, and in the newest Windows. For older windows, you can download [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) to get gitbash)
- Text editor (Atom is a great choice: [Atom](https://atom.io/))


## What are Jekyll and Github Pages?
- Jekyll
  - Static-site generators vs dynamic websites (CMSs and such)
- Git
- Github
- Github Pages
  - User/Organization vs Project Pages

## New site
- Create repo on Github
- Clone to local with empty repo and add to Github Desktop - Click "Set up in Desktop" after creating repo
- From shell, run `jekyll new .`
- Do initial commit with Github desktop and push to remote


## Workflow
- Github desktop distinguishes between fetching and pulling
